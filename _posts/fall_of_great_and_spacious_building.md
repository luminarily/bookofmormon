14 And every anation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall bfall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that cfight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the ddust and great shall be the fall of it.
