# Secret Combinations Are Wicked **ABOVE ALL**

> 18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God;
> 
> [Ether 8:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.18?lang=eng#17)

The Lord views secret combinations wicked above all other things, but why?
As I have studied the scriptures and observed what's happening in the world, I believe it's not only because secret combinations cause people to commit sin en masse, but also lead to genocide and the fall of nations.

It can't be emphasized enough that the Nephite nation fell not because of the Lamanites, but because of an *internal* secret combination!! I wonder how many reading the Book of Mormon truly know this and understand the implications.

> 20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.
> 
> 21 And **they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.**

# THE Secret Combination

There is a Secret Combination set up among the Gentiles in the latter-days - more powerful than *any* prior secret combination.

The question is.. *are you watching for it?*

> 24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this **secret combination** which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.

Did you notice that Mormon speaks of the secret combination in singular terms? This goes directly against this notion that evil is esoteric, amorphous or perhaps even purely chaotic in nature. In certain environments, apparently evil is organized and can take form in worldly institutions and dark interactions. In the case of this secret combination, it is (at some point) organized or coordinated as a single entity. That should give anyone significant pause. And here's why:

> 25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up **seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil**, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.
> 
> [Ether 8:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.25?lang=eng#24)

ALL lands, nations and countries. ALL people.

</div>

It's always been amazing to me how many have a testimony of the Book of Mormon, yet verses like this don't seem to mean anything to them - which is mind-boggling to me, because we know that the Nephite nation was destroyed from within by Gadianton's conspiracy. Was the book not written for our day? Were we not to look for similar things happening in our day!? People, including the little ones, are *dying* because of the evil taking place in the shadows of false information, and we do nothing nor are we able to because we too are blind in our minds.

We *should* be looking for a secret combination (a conspiracy) that threatens the whole planet, and we should be looking *within* the countries of the Gentiles.

(And if we dismiss everything as "conspiracy theory", I think we'd hardly be able to see clearly... we need to *wake up*)

I think the prime suspect by far is the deep state. The globalist agenda. If you dig deep enough, you will find it has infected the U.S., the U.N., the E.U., China, N.K., etc... and you will find that its currency is blackmail, fear, threats and violence. Just look what is happening.

Whatever the Secret Combination is the Globalist Agenda or not, the point is *are you watching for it*?

# There Is Great Danger In Remaining Asleep or Waking Up Too Late

> 20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
> 
> [Isaiah 5:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/5.25?lang=eng#24)

It is becoming more and more apparent how such a phenomenon as putting good for evil and evil for good can take place. I think one of the causes will be failure to watch for signs (including the conspiracies prophesied!)

> 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
> 
> [Luke 21:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/21.36?lang=eng#p36#36)

If one doesn't wake up or wakes up too late, they risk putting evil for good. If they don't wake up, they see what the world wants them to see. If they wake up too late, they may call evil the good which has taken place (since they were blind to it). If you come late to an event and you don't recognize that you're late, you assume it hasn't started yet and so you wait for nothing. Everyone is gone and moved on.

I am not surprised, though I am saddened, when Christians defend policies that are not moral nor good for society. I think this is partially a result of waking up "on the wrong side of the bed" and forming opinions based on a false premise.

We must take action to watch for the influence of this Secret Combination in our lives and recognize if we have woken up to it perhaps a little late so that we can take action to get caught up on some history so that we can see things clearly.

# Conclusion

> 9 Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?

> [Ether 8.9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.9?lang=eng#8)

Secret combinations exploit the will of the flesh and the [evil therin](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.29?lang=eng#28). We are all subject to temptations of the flesh and those who have cast off their moral compass and rejected their conscience to the point where they feel little remorse for evil are cast about by the will of the flesh and the will of the devil who exploits the flesh. This is understood by most.

Is it really so hard to believe that some will sell their fellow countrymen in order to enrich themselves?
