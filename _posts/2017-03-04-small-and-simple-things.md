# By Small & Simple Things

I am writing this post because reducing Trump to a simpleton description (as if that's a bad thing) is not an argument and, if you're going to criticize Trump, find a better reason.

* "Is Donald Trump a simpleton?" - vis-a-vis [AARP Online Community][2]
* "Trump is a complete simpleton." - [libertybill on Tumblr][3]
* "Donald Trump is just a simpleton." - [/u/AgeOfHorus on Reddit][4]
* "Donald Trump Talks Like a Third-Grader ... If you were to market Donald Trump’s vocabulary as a toy, it would resemble a small box of Lincoln Logs." - [Jack Shafer - Politico][5]
* "Donald Trump's use of grammar 'typical of children aged 11 and under'" - [Serina Sandhu - INDEPENDENT.co.uk][6]

**Do you ever find yourself in surreal awe that Donald Trump is the President?** Considering the forces that were working against him, I often find myself thinking that if Trump had changed anything about his character or technique or delivery, he would not have been able to win.

<div class="b cb2">
	There was an extremely narrow 'job' opening for a "people's president", the requirements of which Trump fit immaculately.
</div>

Trump's simple, sensationalist nature was contagious and spread like wildfire. His *quirks, misspellings, and yes, even his mistakes, filled the news cycles*. Even his vast monetary resources allowed him to remain unfazed by bribes and threats (which surely came, either direct or implied).

His brash, sincere and yet strong, courageous approach allowed him to weather the onslaught of "slings and arrows" the establishment hurled at him day after day, word after word, and minute after minute.

People criticize his approach, but honestly, who are we to critique a man who pulled off the *impossible*? **Is there anyone else in America that could have and *would have* done what Trump did?** I don't think it's likely there is anyone.

The scriptures make no case against such those who speak simply.

> 23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; **little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.**
> 
> [Alma 32:23][7] (Book of Mormon)

Indeed - how the establishment has been confounded by one such as Donald Trump is nothing short of miraculous.

Fan or not, you gotta admit Trump pulled off one of the most jaw-dropping feats in modern times.

Trump had almost the entire establishment against him:

* Fortune 500 companies? >> Against Trump.
* Mainstream Media? >> Against Trump.
* U.S. government? >> Against Trump.
* Hollywood? >> Against Trump.

> 6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by **small and simple things are great things brought to pass**; and **small means in many instances doth confound the wise.**
> 
> 7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and **by very small means** *the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.*
> 
> [Alma 37:6-7][1] (Book of Mormon)

The Establishment - with UNLIMITED funds, power, resources, and corrupt dealings - were ultimately **confounded** by Trump, the simpleton.<br><br>They could not, no not even with all their complex machinations, systems of control and thought-curation through media propaganda -- stop ONE MAN from toppling their entire reality.

Who would have thought Trump's tactic of going directly to the people and telling them to put their country first would be so effective? He would use widely-comprehensible phrases such as "we don't *win* anymore."

If instead he said "there's a conspiracy that is trying to turn America into a communist state," he would have lost! It was genius on Trump's part to boil hard-to-swallow realities down to simple forms the majority could understand.

> the things which were written were **plain and pure**, and most precious and **easy to the understanding of *all* men.**
> 
> [1st Nephi 14:23][14]

How is it that simple things confound the wise? How can a simple tool destoy a complex and terrible machine?

In Bensalem, Pennsylvania on October 28th, Mike Pence said..

> **"Truth is a force of nature. Truth has a way of making its way out."**

Substance will always trump fantasy. Trump focused on speaking to the forgotten American with simple truths about our government.

All the establishment has power over is their narrative and illusion. As long as the people are kept in darkness to the substance of truth, they are controllable. Once the people wake up to the illusion, the vain imagination collapses and eventually the cunning subverters will be revealed.

> 21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became **vain in their imaginations**, and *their **foolish** heart was darkened.*
> 
> [Romans 1:21][8] (Bible)

Trump would often say in his speeches, "this is reality," when referring to the corrupt establishment and his plain way of describing what needed to be done.

Simple and plain things are often true. Because they are true, they have an unbreakable foundation, whereas lies are built on an imaginary base which, if discovered, begins to crumble.

> 24 ¶Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
> 
> 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
> 
> 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which **built his house upon the sand**:
> 
> 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and **great was the fall of it**.
> 
> [Matthew 7:24-27][9] (Bible)

Those who build their lives around falsehood and lies eventually meet the day when the fiery simplicity of truth vaporizes their illusory foundation - a day when their vain ambition meets simple, unrelenting reality.
