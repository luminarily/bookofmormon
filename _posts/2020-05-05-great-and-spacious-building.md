# Who inhabits the Great and Spacious Building?

> 26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
> 
> 27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.
> 
> 28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.
>

See [1st Nephi Chapter 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng) for the full vision.

While growing up, and still, I observed there was and is a general understanding among many of the Church that Great and Spacious building is anyone who criticizes clean living, morality or goodness. It was generally accepted, though rarely vocalized, that the great and spacious building was organized or that institutions were a part of it. For instance, maybe gangs could be a part of it but, certainly not a pharmaceutical company or a university.

Reducing the building down to a simple all-inclusive definition of all evil, in my opinion, removes an essential lesson to be learned from the scripture: that evil can be *organized*; that institutions (and even individuals) can be owned/controlled by powerful players, which, if you follow the dark chain long enough, you eventually find the satanists.

Evil does organize itself in its own dark way. It is not always some amorphous, chaotic blob. The reason I feel confident in saying this is because of the building which Lehi saw in his dream. Buildings are complicated, organized, man-made structures. Satan "buys" worldly institutions, not by money but by the law of mahan (which, in short, is the currency of hell: get gain by any means necessary, particularly blackmail, threats, fraud and murder).

Many fell away from the fruit of the tree because of the loud mockings of those in a "great and spacious" building which, it would seem, had no foundation as it was "in the air". Regardless, the building stood for a time and those in the building mocked those at the tree.

For the most part, I don't think that those who inhabit the building are average individuals.
I believe that they are generally people and institutions with status, influence, wealth or power; after all, the building inhabitants did an an elevated status, however illusory.

Does the drug addict down the street have an elevated status? They may be traveling down a strange and forbidden path, but I wouldn't classify them as being elevated in the building. The building gives those in it wordly authority and power. [Sound familiar](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13.1-2?lang=eng#1)?

Identifying who inhabits the great and spacious building can help one see the form of evil, as it presents itself in individuals, institutions, and nefarious agendas.

###### The Pride of the World

> 36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that **the great and spacious building was the pride of the world**; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[1st Nephi 11:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36?lang=eng&clang=eng#p36)

I used to think this verse only meant the general pride of the world, as in the arrogant quality exhibited by individuals.

However, perhaps there's more to it.

What is the pride of your life? Probably your crowning achievement.

What could be the pride of the world? Sure, pride as a stumbling block is one meaning, but where one's treasure is where will be there heart also and their *pride*. In the case of the world, I see no better candidate than the beast of revelation.

The beast of revelation is so valued by the world, that a second beast is created just to cause the inhabitants of the earth to worship the first beast!

## Likely Inhabitants of the Great and Spacious Building

There are arguments for each of these and why they are almost undoubtedly inhabitants of the Great and Spacious building, but that would be far too much for this post. A simple list will suffice for now.

Not everyone in these institutions are corrupt!! But, given the amount of money involved and what has been circulating in the news, these institutions have elements yoke the saints down in sin, financial bondage, sickness and knowledge-deprivation (censorship).

- Hollywood
- Big Pharma
- Universities
- Politicians
- CEOs
- Big Tech
- Deep State / Shadow Government
- CIA
- House of Saud (prior to U.S. control)
- Rothschild
- Soros
- The Federal Reserve

#### What would the fall of the great and spacious building look like?

It might look like the populace seeing Hollywood celebrities for what they are: talented actors for the most part, and in some cases sick individuals which prey on others. There have been enough scandals at this point that I think that can be said safely. You might see a lot of angry comments on twitter at celebs, comments which seem to suggest a change has taken place in how people view Hollywood:

```
"Hollywood ain't cool anymore. Hollywood's going down. I still talk to my sources ... listen - there is a big operation going down." -David Rodriguez, World Heavy Weight Champion boxer
```
David Rodriguez said this in a facebook live event in mid-april, 2020. You can see the clip at the Edge of Wonder [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO_ilJOZWM8)

- It might look like a corrupt ruling-class blind-sided by a populist candidate who won an election that shocked the world.

- It might look like Saudi Arabia declaring martial law and corruption getting purged by a newly-elected president.

- It might look like trillion-dollar net-worth families (which own the Federal Reserve) lashing out against Reagan-esque policies.

- It might look like celebrities going to prison for horrific crimes.

- It might look like CEOs resigning in record numbers.

- It might look like tens of thousands of sealed indictments (being the early stages of the fall..)

- It might look like millions coming to Christ as they have discovered evil for the first time.
