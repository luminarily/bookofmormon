## Great and Spacious Building

I believe we're seeing the collpase of the Great and Spacious Building (GaSB) as described in the Book of Mormon. As odd as it may sound, the election has created an environment where the powers

I'm writing this blog because I believe this collapse is coming and I don't want people to miss it. We've been waiting on this prophecy for hundreds of years; how sad if we miss it for not looking.


## Great & Spacious Building

"Did I read that right?" Yes, you did. In the Book of Mormon, we read of a Great and Spacious Building (GaSB):

Excerpt from Lehi's dream in the Book of Mormon. [2nd Nephi 8:26-28](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26-28?lang=eng)

>26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.

>27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.

>28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.

If you're not LDS, don't worry - the Great and Spacious Building is synonymous with The Establishment. There will probably be more Great and Spacious Buildings in the future, but the fall of the Establishment as initiated by DJT is if not THE Great and Spacious Building, then a similitude at least. I capitalized GaSB because in this case it represents the Establishment. Here are some main segments of the Establishment:

* Hollywood.
* Washington.
* Corporate America.
* ISIS (yep. follow the money.)
* New World Order (and all of its demon-spawned puppet organizations).

How do I know? Because these are the institutions which came out in vocal and public opposition to Trump. He was not kidding when he said that he represented an existential threat to the Establishment. You may run into people who feel negatively about this threat - they don't realize... they are unwittingly FOR the Establishment. They don't know how bad things have gotten. They don't know about the Bilderberg Group. They don't know about the Rothschilds or the Federal Reserve. They don't know about the Clinton Foundation or George Soros and his habit of toppling foreign governments. They don't know about Soros funding the riots occurring in the U.S. They don't know about the Satan worship happening with the corrupt individuals high up in the Establishment. They don't know about spirit cooking, or the pedophile rings. So, I don't blame them for thinking Trump is worse than Hillary. MSM doesn't talk about any of this stuff. They control the narrative. If you trust MSM as your source of news, I can almost guarantee you were devastated by Trump's victory - not of any fault of your own, but because of the narrative portrayed by the media. People will say, "I'm mad because of Trump's own words!!" They would be relieved beyond measure if they spent a week researching the Clintons that Hillary didn't get in. Hillary is a MUCH greater evil than Trump if that's how you want to look at it. But, Trump is not an "evil". In fact, as I said before, he will probably be the best president we've had since Washington.

Mormons are very sensitive regarding anything sexual - including words. My advice? Get over it. People are imperfect. They make mistakes. Extend forgiveness and stop judging. You don't know what Trump has gone through during the campaign. He's been publicly humiliated for the ENTIRE PLANET to hear his audio recording. What effect would that have on you? Would you want people to immediately judge you and think you were the worst person on the planet? Nope. The Church recently [released videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZCpRddEXZM&index=6&list=PLAYgY8SPtEWGdk48FbKS9nIJ4mEcj_U5x) about not judging others. I suggest watching them because they help temper judgment against others.

Have you ever felt mocked because you felt there was something wrong with the country? Have you ever been criticized for no trusting an establishment organization - big pharma, the Federal Reserve or otherwise? You're probably one of the ones Lehi saw in his dream.

Notice, the GaSB does *not* have a foundation. It's in the air. It's the illusion of stability. Can you imagine building your life on a lie? What a shaky foundation. Yet, that's EXACTLY what the Establishment has done!

* Big pharma has been built on drugs which lie to the body saying "nothing's wrong, we'll take care of the pain." Drugs cure nothing.
* The Federal Reserve has been build on a lie because it is not backed by any physical valuable like gold.
* Washington has been built on the lies of corruption (e.g. the Clinton foundation).
* Hollywood has been built on the lie that some humans are more important than others.

I think you get the picture. Our current society is a lie. When Donald Trump was campaigning, he said "All I'm doing is telling the truth." How profound. Donald Trump is going to start the collapse of the GaSB via Truth. Ideas are [bulletproof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WZ0XSf23rs) and words will always retain their [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Ehms1ShMQ).

Recall what happens to the GaSB in the Book of Mormon:

Excerpt from Lehi's dream in the Book of Mormon. [2nd Nephi 8:36](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.36?lang=eng)

>36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

The GaSB fell. **Great was the fall of it.** There was nothing the Establishment shills could do to stop its fall. Sound familiar? Trump was a tactical nuke, aimed by God, at the heart of Establishment. Despite all of Obamas rallies and all of his speeches, no one could put Hillary Clinton's campaign back together again.

### Weeping, Wailing & Gnashing of Teeth

What happens when days of reckoning come?
Weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth [D&C 19:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.5?lang=eng#4)

>5 Wherefore, I revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are found on my left hand.

Interestingly, the Left as well as the Left Hand of God, are where liberals find themselves at this time.

Behold, the [weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grD_IINiH9c) Warning - liberals have potty mouths!

There's a change underway. Of course, this is not the final judgment. But - it is a judgment nonetheless. Those who are truly on the left - rioting is them weeping, wailing and gnashing their teeth. So, when people are calling them crybabies, well.. it's kind of true. They're throwing a tantrum like a small child because the judgment of God has come down upon this land - and they are found on the receiving end of it due to their false ideologies.

If you've read this far and you've taken the <span class="blue">blue pill</span>, you are without doubt offended to the core and will feel a very strong urge to send me an angry comment or personal attack... I will tell you to [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Gpc69btRg).
