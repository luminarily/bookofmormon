Freedom is contingent on not being deceived. Not being deceived is contingent on *watching*

##### Learning about "conspiracy theories" is not "beyond the mark"

Have you ever been part of a conversation where someone brings up an alternative explanation to a national event only to have the discussion shut down by the comment "that's beyond the mark" or "you need to focus on the Gospel"?

Or perhaps they say, "that's just a conspiracy theory," or "you need to focus on what matters."?

Of all the psychological predispositions, this has got to be one of the worst. 

Most other discrepancies in thought can be resolved, but this engenders ignorance in the fight between good and evil, indeed could lead to a state where the Second Coming of Jesus catches one as a thief in the night and I will prove it using scripture.

**Instead of dismissing and covering one's ears, engage based on the merits of a particular idea or hypothesis.**

# Exhibit A: Watch Ye Therefore / "No Man Knows The Hour"

I have shared in many previous posts about [secret combinations]({% post_url 2020-05-08-the-secret-combination %}) and how Moroni says they were the cause of the destruction of the Nephite nation and how the Book of Mormon was written for our day, etc...

The Lord has commanded us to watch the signs of the times so that we are aware of the seasons and are not deceived! If secret combinations, according to the Book of Mormon are wicked above all, and if secret combinations work IN DARKNESS, we cannot see them unless we look *deeply*. We cannot see them unless we think critically, and for ourselves. We cannot see them unless we research. The choice, to know, is ours. And ours alone.

How is it that Jesus can come as a thief in the night?

> 1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
> 
> 2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
> 
> 3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
> 
> 4 **But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.**
> 
> 5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

> 6 **Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.**

* Jesus will come as a thief in the night to those who do not watch.
* Jesus will NOT come as a thief in the night to those who watch.

It's as simple as that.

What does it mean to watch? If you have to ask this question, I worry if you are watching as you should and time is running out for you to wake up and start watching. If you find yourself comfortable in your righteousness and testimony of God - great, but be aware that if you do not watch - conscientiously - there is risk of being deceived. Without active effort to find truth, one gives one's self to whatever truth the world pushes.

Speaking of the end times, Jesus said,

> 3 ¶ And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
> 
> 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
> 
> 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
>

Furthermore, he admonishes us to *watch*. In other words, pay attention to the events. Do you think he specifically meant just watch the news? What if the news was controlled by the Secret Combination as explained in the Book of Mormon? No, we must pay attention to layers deeper than those news organizations with ties to the special interests of beast of Revelation - the Cabal.

> 42 ¶ Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
> 
> 43 But know this, that *if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.*
> 
> 44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
> 
> [matt/24.42-44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.42-44?lang=eng#41)

As we watch and see the signs of the times, we gain strength to lead our families, prevent them from being broken up. We gain strength against sin for we know and can see that the battle between good and evil is real.

"Yeah but, no man knows the hour..."

And yet...

> 28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
> 
> 29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
> 
> 30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
> 
> [mark/13.28-30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/13.28-30?lang=eng&clang=eng#p27)

As a side note: why do those who say no man knows the hour as an excuse to not watch never quote the scripture where Jesus teaches us that we can know the summer is nigh due to the fig tree putting forth its leaves? Holistic scripture study is important!!! Each verse of scripture should be taken as a part of the whole in order to be understood as best as possible. You could build a satanic church if you took only one verse of scripture and made that your one and only mantra.

We *can* know when the coming of Christ is nigh and we have been commanded to watch and be ready. If you look at the Book of Mormon or the words of many of the prophets of the Church, their words constantly point toward secret combinations and the need to be aware and fight against them.

I mean, take the Word of Wisdom revelation for example - 

> 4 Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation
> 
> [dc/89.4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.4?lang=eng#3)

That's just one example. Or listen to President Ezra Taft Benson. He had worked as a government official in agriculture and knew better than most what was taking place in the government and he's known as the "conspiracy" prophet because of how much he talked about it. Joseph Smith prophesied about it as well if I remember correctly.

And yet... **you can barely speak of secret combinations in the modern age without being labeled a conspiracy theorist.** It is also the reason why I believe, and have believed for some time, that to see many of the signs of the coming of Christ, you'll have to risk being labeled a conspiracy theorist.

# Exhibit B: Captain Moroni.

The following verse has always fascinated me:

> 17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.
> 
> [alma/48.17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.17?lang=eng#16)

What does this have to do with the current topic? That's what's so fascinating.

What was so special about Captain Moroni? He was a good man, yes. He was a war general, yes. Why was Captain Moroni given such high praise and others in the Book of Mormon, though amazing individuals, were not? That's what's so interesting.

I think there's a lesson here. Captain Moroni was passionate and full of ACTION. He learned about the strategies and evil designs of the Lamanites. He knew of the secret combinations. He lead the Nephite armies to not only defend their lands against the Lamanites, but had the open mind and open heart to believe the words of Pahoran who told him there was an *enemy within* when Moroni sent him an epistle wondering where his reinforcements were:

> 3 But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have **risen up in rebellion against me**, and also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.
> 
> 4 And it is those who have **sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity**; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.
> 
> [alma/61.3-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61.3-4?lang=eng#p2)

Moroni did not hesitate to take the fight against the insurrection. He could have dismissed Pahoran's letter as a "conspiracy theory" - can you imagine? Yet that is the mindset of many currently. The Nephites were at war with the Lamanites, there's no way some of them would conspire to take control of the government at that time, right?

> 7 And it came to pass that **Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies** into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.
> 
> 8 And behold, **Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners**, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.
> 
> 9 And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men, **whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death**.
> 
> 10 **And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed according to the law.**
> 
> [alma/62.7-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62.7-10?lang=eng#6)

Moroni was not kidding around. He confronted secret combinations SWIFTLY. He knew their destructive power. On top of this, he was a good man who followed God, and yet was constantly sending spies to know of the movements of the Lamanites and also calling upon Alma, the prophet, for guidance. Again, how can such a man who was not a prophet be given such high praise by Mormon (the author of the Book of Mormon)?

> 23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites.
> 
> [alma/43.23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.23?lang=eng#22)

Further more, Moroni was a patriot. When the Nephites were faltering, he inspired and lead them by raising a title of liberty

> 12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it—**In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.**
> 
> 13 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, **so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land**
> 
> [alma/46.12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.12?lang=eng#11)

He didn't mention Christ on his title of liberty, but it is understood *For Christ and God are one in all aspects that matter.*

I'd imagine the same neuron path that leads one to say studying conspiracies / secret combinations is beyond the mark would lead one to say to Captain Moroni "you're overbearing" or "you're too passionate". I believe Captain Moroni received the praise he did because he:

1. *learned* the destructive power of corrupt political agendas & secret combinations
2. *fought* against such agendas with legendary might and 
3. was a righteous man of God personally.
