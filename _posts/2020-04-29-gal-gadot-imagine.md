In March of 2020, Gal Gadot and a bunch of celebrities sang the song "Imagine" by John Lennon.

This post isn't about Gal Gadot - maybe she meant well. Despite the pleasing melody, the lyrics of this song are deceptive in my view.

Read carefully...

```
Imagine there's no Heaven. It's easy if you try.
No hell below us. Above us only sky.
Imagine all the people. Living for today.
Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do.
Nothing to kill or die for. And no religion too.
Imagine all the people. Living for today.
You may say that I'm a dreamer.
But I'm not the only one.
I hope some day you will join us.
And the world will live as one.
Imagine no possessions. I wonder if you can.
No need for greed and hunger.
Brotherhood of man.
Sharing all the world.
```

> 22 And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none—and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.

> 44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.

Nothing to die for means nothing worth living for either.

# Conclusion

Gal Gadot truly was wonderful in Wonder Woman, but are these the people / concepts we want to be looking toward during the COVID-19 crisis?

I think I've made my point and the rest is self-evident.
