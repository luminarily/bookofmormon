The strategy of the elites. The cunning of the Gadiantions. They discovered what? That they may murder and get gain. So, what do they do? They do it.

In today's digital and highly accessible world, publicity makes outright theft difficult. So, what is done instead? Legislate and mandate rules, laws and regulations which lead souls into welfare - into a world where robbing is not only legal, but desirable and encouraged.

### Of course we are to **give** of our substance to the poor!!<br>This is different than being ROBBED of our substance.

The [Gadiantons][16] who have created the atmospherics for such a world are guilty of much, much more than collusion and corrupt legislation, for they are followers of the Mahanic principle.

Our enemies are many and abroad. There are *countries* which wish to use nuclear weapons on the United States. We cannot afford to be fighting an internal battle against a party who lost an election, fair and square.
