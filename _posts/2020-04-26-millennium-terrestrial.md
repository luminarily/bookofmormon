# The Millennium is a terrestrial state.

<div class="b cb2">
	"When our Savior comes, the earth will be changed to a terrestrial condition ... this condition will last until after the close of the millennium..."
</div>

```
"When our Savior comes, the earth will be changed to a terrestrial condition and will then be made the fit abode for terrestrial beings, and this condition will last until after the close of the millennium when the earth will die and be raised again in a resurrection to receive its glory as a celestial body, which is its final state. We are living in the great day of restoration. The Lord has declared that all things are to be restored to their primitive condition. Our Tenth Article of Faith says, "We believe . . . that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." Too many have the idea that this has reference to the celestialized earth, but this is not the case. It refers to the restored earth as it will be when Christ comes to reign. This is taught in Isaiah 65:17-25, and in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 101:23-31. (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:85)"
```
[- Joseph Fielding Smith](https://emp.byui.edu/satterfieldb/quotes/Millennium/Earth%20in%20Terrestrial%20Condition.html)

```
We understand, of course, that there will be many nonmembers of the Church living during the Millennium, but there will be a clear willingness by all the good and decent men and women of all the races, creeds, and cultures to abide by a terrestrial law.
```
[Sermons Not Spoken, p.81](https://emp.byui.edu/satterfieldb/quotes/Millennium/Earth%20in%20Terrestrial%20Condition.html)

The Millennium is the "thousand years of peace" that will come due to Christ and also due to societies rejecting government corruption and cultural degeneracy. You may have noticed that more and more, people are rejecting Hollywood and are taking an interest in reality.

Understanding the conditions of the Millennium can help us make sense of what is taking place now.

## Terrestrial law is a moral law.

> 36 All kingdoms have a law given;
>
> 37 And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom.
>
> 38 And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.
>
> 39 All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.
> 
> [D&C 88:36-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.36-39?lang=eng#35) (Doctrine & Covenants)

It is important to note, that those that can inhabit a certain kingdom are those that are willing to abide by either the law of that kingdom *or the law of a higher*. We also know beings can travel to lesser kingdoms, but one cannot travel to a higher kingdom unless their soul (body & spirit) are fit for the law of that kingdom.

It would seem common that those who wish to abide a higher law almost always have to abide a lesser kingdom for a time.

This should come as no surprise as even Christ did.

<div class="b cb3">
	It may be confusing, if one is expecting the conditions of a celestial world, as this telestial world shakes off the chains of the devil and begins to enter a terrestrial world.
</div>

Following Christ, getting baptized, accepting Christ as your Savior, at not required for the Terrestrial state.

> 71 And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.
> 
> 72 Behold, these are they who died without law;
> 
> 73 And also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the gospel unto them, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh;
> 
> 74 Who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it.
> 
> 75 These are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men.
> 
> 76 These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness.
> 
> 77 These are they who receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father.
> 
> 78 Wherefore, they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon differs from the sun.
> 
> 79 These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.
> 
> [D&C 76:71-79](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.71-79?lang=eng#35) (Doctrine & Covenants)


We can infer that the law of the Millennium will be, basically, the Ten Commandments. Be honorable. Be good. Maybe one doesn't "follow" Jesus, maybe one isn't baptized persay, maybe one doesn't even believe in Jesus. But, they are a good person nonetheless. They don't lie, they don't steal, they don't kill, etc...

<div class="b cb2">
	Progress in lower kingdoms should not be discounted, for progress is progress.
	If a telestial being chooses to abide a terrestrial law, is that not a good thing?
</div>

## Terrestrial worlds are inhabited by terrestrial beings.

It makes logical sense that in order for a terrestrial world to be considered terrestrial, it may only be inhabited by terrestrial beings.

This just makes sense to me and is related to the doctrine that no unclean thing can abide the presence of God (celestial glory).

In other words, the Millennium will comprise people of all kinds of nationalities and faiths but they will all have something in common: they are *moral*.

I would not expect nation states to end.

Do not expect everyone to suddenly accept Christ as their Savior. We are going from telestial (our current state) to terrestrial.

<div class="b cb2">
	The earth must shed that which makes it telestial if it is to attain terrestrial glory.
</div>

# From Exaltation to Exaltation

The world is waking up and progress is being made! Line upon line, precept upon precept - all of creation is preparing to meet its Creator, and there are millions who need time to prepare where they are at in their journey, such is the mercy of our Lord!

As the way of the Lord is prepared, people will wake up to truth and technologies will be released. This is happening right now.

**Let us not resist when we see such wonderful change taking place in this world. Let us receive the revolution and enlightenment with gladness and rejoice that others are waking up!**

Exaltation - collectively and individually - is a *process*.

Attaining transcendance from the corrupt realm of flesh is a process, battle by battle, overcoming each thing which tries to overcome us.

```
“Here, then, is eternal life﻿—to know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, … by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power. …
```
[-Joseph Smith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-18.p15?lang=eng#p15#p15)

As a society, we have many things to overcome. Water purification, hunger, cancer, disease, depression, pornography and so on. What if you knew that culture is downstream of hollywood and hollywood is downstream to politics? What if you knew big tech muffles truth? The #GreatAwakening of the masses will lead to us shaking off the chains by which we're bound.

> 60 And they shall overcome all things.
>
> [D&C 76.58-60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.58-60?lang=eng#57)

Let's place our trust in God so that we can overcome all things! This is the grand promise. For that is the direction we must go if we are to usher in the Millenium:

> 17 For behold, the Lord God hath sent forth the angel crying through the midst of heaven, saying: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight, for the hour of his coming is nigh
> 
> [D&C 133.17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.17?lang=eng#p17#17)

## New technologies, some lost to history, will be revealed.

Chlorine dioxide. Hydroxychloroquine? Sunlight. U.V. therapies. Heat, etc...

The Book of Mormon repeatedly makes mention of the corrupt nature of non-immortalized flesh.

> 21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.
> 
> [Mormon 6:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6.21?lang=eng&clang=eng#p20)

For us to discover and value these technologies, we show God we want what he has to offer. We humbly know He is the author and finisher of our faith and we cannot supplant His blessings. But as we seek to lessen suffering on the Earth, we lessen the temporal corruption of our world.

Precursors will emerge prior to the millennium as the world takes an active role in moving toward it. Meaning, it makes sense that we will see some aspects of the Millennium start to emerge even now (albeit in lesser forms).

There will be 

- Space-age technological advancement.
- Curative therapies uncovered and released.
- Enlightenment. Knowledge of our place in the universe.
- Rejection of evil.
- Mixed religion will continue.
- Governments will still exist.

## During the Millennium, Satan will be bound by righteousness.

Satan will not be bound by some divine force. The people will be awakened and elightening to a point where Satan will no longer have power over their hearts.

> 26 And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth.
> 
> [1st Nephi 22:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.26?lang=eng#p26) (Book of Mormon)

Also see [D&C 45:55](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p55#p55)

<div class="b cb2">
	How can the people be righteous *globally* save it be that they have woken up? How can the people choose good unless they have learned the evil from the good? How can righteousness prevail, even in high places, save it be that the voters are awake and aware and the politicians are also aware of the consequences of sin and conspiracy? Have you heard of the #GreatAwakening? Methinks we are, of a truth, barreling toward the Millennium, for the people are awakening from their slumber.
</div>

Unfortunately, we are yet a ways off. The consequence of being asleep for so long is that we also must go through a tribulation before Christ can come.

<!-- # Agency will still exist during the Millennium

How do we know (for the Millennium at least)? Because near the end, Satan will be loosed again due to the poor choices of individuals. (God will ensure agency will always exist. After all, He cast Satan out over the same issue.)

> 110 And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound his trump; and he shall stand forth upon the land and upon the sea, and swear in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne, that there shall be time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space of a thousand years.
> 
> 111 And then he shall be loosed for a little season, that he may gather together his armies.
> 
> 112 And Michael, the seventh angel, even the archangel, shall gather together his armies, even the hosts of heaven.
> 
> 113 And the devil shall gather together his armies; even the hosts of hell, and shall come up to battle against Michael and his armies.
> 
> 114 And then cometh the battle of the great God; and the devil and his armies shall be cast away into their own place, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at all.
>
> [D&C 88:110-114](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.110-114?lang=eng#109) -->

# Conclusion

The Millennium will not be a perfect state, though it will be a higher glory. There will be other religions. Nation states will exist. People will not necessarily accept Christ as their Savior though they will value morality and goodness. Conspiracies and evil plots will be eradicated. People will still have agency, since it has been prophesied they will fall away at the end of the Millennium, thus Satan will be loosened again.
