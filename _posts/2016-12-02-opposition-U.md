## Division & Reconciliation

The recent election was clearly not typical. Indeed, it was divisive.

Although the election was divisive for most individuals due to the opposing narratives they followed, in the higher echelons of social and political ranking, those with access to more closely-guarded intel, I believe the division went much deeper.

For the general population, the issues were about 

## Evil vs. Good

[Isaiah 5:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20?lang=eng)

>20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

Wow. What a powerful description of this election cycle.

This is not surprising though, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction - and indeed, there's opposition in all things:

[2nd Nephi 2:11-12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11-12)

>11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.

>12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.

This election was not about personality. It was about fundamental policy. People were offended and in some cases they were in shock when Trump won - because they were on a train that was being driven by the MSM.

This election has been extremely <span class="red">p</span><span class="blue">o</span><span class="red">l</span><span class="blue">a</span><span class="red">r</span><span class="blue">i</span><span class="red">z</span><span class="blue">i</span><span class="red">n</span><span class="blue">g</span> - and with good reason. If you thought it was about the personality of the candidates, think again. No, this election was about <span class="white-stroke">fundamental principles</span>. Political stances, no not really. To name a few, this election was about Americanism vs Globalism, illegal immigration vs. taking care of our citizens, prevention of murder in the case of unnecessary abortions. Don't misunderstand. Did I say "prevention of murder in the case of abortions"? No. I said "unnecessary". Further more, the discussion is different depending on the age of the fetus. Would you be more for / against a blastocyst or and 8-month old unborn child? Of course. I won't get bogged down in the details of this, there's much more ground to cover.

Have you noticed that arguments you get in don't go anywhere? Someone always has a counter-argument or they simply turn your argument back on you. There is a reason for this. Are you sure you're ready for it?

One side is right and one is wrong.

There is opposition in all things.
