# Walls Are Scriptural

The media constantly says that walls are divisive and not necessary. And yet, the scriptures have hundreds of references to walls being used by the righteous.

* [Instance count:][2]
	* Old Testament: **216**
	* New Testament: **11**
	* Book of Mormon: **40**
	* Doctrine & Covenants: **5**
	* Pearl of Great Price: **1**

The Nephites built walls to defend themselves against the Lamanites, who hated them and their way of life.

> 5 And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.
> 
> 6 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly **he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls** round about and preparing places of resort.
> 
> [Alma 52:5-6][1] (Book of Mormon)

Teancum thought it necessary to protect himself by keeping his soldiers close and by building walls.

> 37 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had **fought valiantly for his country**, yea, a true **friend to liberty**; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.
> 
> [Alma 62:37][5] (Book of Mormon)

However, it's true that sometimes walls need to be broken down.

> 3 Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, **I am against thee, O Tyrus**, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
>
> 4 And they shall **destroy the walls of Tyrus**, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
> 
> [Ezekiel 26:3-4][6] (Bible)

What do people mean when they say they don't believe in walls? Be grateful walls believe in you, because without them you would be cold, robbed, ravaged and humiliated. Walls are important to civilization.

If you have ever unfriended, blocked or unfollowed anyone on Facebook or Twitter, guess what? You believe in walls, because you believe in boundaries.

Limhi, a righteous king, had walls to protect himself and wouldn't leave the city without guards.

> 19 And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.
> 
> [Mosiah 21:19][3] (Book of Mormon)

Just yet another example in scripture, which, if we paid attention to, we wouldn't be offended people want *enforced* borders.

Let's go deeper and more specific.

America has an immigration problem. Certainly, not all of these people are bad. But, that's not really the point, is it? The point is, we should do what we can to protect our culture, our safety and our freedom from forces which would take it away. How can we be sure of this without enforced borders? Walls, being a physical enforcement rather than technological or digital, have some level of efficacy.

Consider these verses in the Book of Mormon about Moroni - who was and is regarded as one of the brightest-shining examples of righteousness in the Book of Mormon. He built walls about the cities and the borders of their lands.

> 7 Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been **obtaining power by fraud and deceit**, Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.
> 
> 8 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of resort; **throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, ROUND ABOUT their cities and the BORDERS of their lands; YEA, ALL ROUND ABOUT THE LAND.**
> 
> [Alma 48:7-8][7] (Book of Mormon)

While Amalickiah was an evil man who sought power through deception and fraud, Moroni was building walls and preparing his armies. Sounds like someone else we knew who was **flying around giving rally after rally, preparing people** to make the right choice and support liberty.

I think it's pretty clear from scripture that our Heavenly Father endorses walls when we use them to protect our freedom, our republic and our security.

Borders are a secondary and related element for the protection of nations.

* [Border reference count][4] is as follows:
	* Old Testament: **164**
	* New Testament: **5**
	* Book of Mormon: **68**
	* Doctrine & Covenants: **7**
	* Pearl of Great Price: **1**

But, how can a loving God, who [esteemeth all flesh in one][9], endorse borders? Certainly there must be a way of reconciling this. There is, and we'll get to it shortly.

Do you believe in a world without borders? But no borders sounds so good and inclusive, right? Tolerance for all? Mingling of all sorts with no nation-states to limit movement! It's a "cushy" statement, and it sounds good. But, no, it doesn't work... not on this world at least.

```
"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders..."
```
-[Hillary Rodham Clinton][15]

It's easy to signal to others by using buzzwords that you believe in "open" borders and "free" trade with a "common" market. The reality of such a scenario is that it requires a consolidation of political power, on a global scale, to enact such a scenario. It also invariably leads to a corruption of culture and values. See my post on [conspiracies]({% post_url 2017-02-21-conspiracies %}) for more information on the global threat.

Wall-less and borderless society will eventually become corrupted by outside forces. Walls and borders are necessary to preserve culture and shared values:

> 1 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
>
> 2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
> 
> [Ezra 9:1-2][8] (Bible)

Proximity + moral / ideological diversity inevitably lead to conflict.

But, again, back to the point - how can a loving God not wish for [all things to be common][10] among His children? He does, but [all things must be done in order][11] as there is a [time and a season to all things][12].

So, how do we reconcile this? What's the solution? The Lord gives us a hint.

> 24 For **I** will cast out the nations before thee, and **enlarge thy borders**: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.
>
> [Exodus 34:24][14] (Bible)

> 31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and **enlarge thy borders** forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.
> 
> [Moroni 10:31][13] (Book of Mormon)

Have and respect walls and borders. Enlarge them when the time is right.

We ought to trust the Lord to enlarge our borders as He will, but in times of war and distress, strong walls and borders take priority and are not evil.
