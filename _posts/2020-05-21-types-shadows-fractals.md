There are fractals in scripture, just like there fractals in nature. There are prophetic patterns to watch for.

The scriptures [speak of this concept](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/jesus-christ-types-of-in-anticipation?lang=eng) in terms of "types" and "shadows".

# Heavenly Types

**Isaiah Was a "type" of Christ**

> 6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
> 
> 7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
> 
> 8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: Here am I; send me.
> 
> [2-ne/16.6-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/16.6-8?lang=eng#5)

**The Law of Moses was a type of things to come**

> 30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.
> 
> 31 But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types of things to come.
> 
> [mosiah/13.30-31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.30-31?lang=eng#p29)

**The Liahona was a type of the word of Christ**

> 45 And now I say, is there not a atype in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.

> [alma/37.45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.45?lang=eng#p45)

##### Anti-Christ Types

In general, what is an anti-christ?

> 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
> 
> [1-jn/2.22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2.22?lang=eng#21)

In the end times the bible speaks of anti-christs to come:

> 18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
> 
> [1-jn/2.18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2.18?lang=eng#17)

As well as a single final Anti-Christ:

> 20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
> 
> [rev/19.20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19.20?lang=eng#20)

What shadows do we have of this Anti-Christ?

**Korihor**

> 6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.
> 
> 12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:
> 
> [alma/30.6,12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.6,12?lang=eng#5)

(As a side note - the law only goes so far, and do not be surprised if Anti-Christs have full autonomy to bring about their nefarious purposes. "If they were that evil, we would know and they would be stopped!" - Not necessarily.)

**Jacob**

"The chief judge is murdered, the government is destroyed, and the people divide into tribes—Jacob, an anti-Christ, becomes king of a secret combination"

> 9 Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;
> 
> [3-ne/7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng)

**Sherem**

The scriptures don't specifically mention that Sherem is an anti-christ, but going by the general definition, I think it's worth noting:

> 9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.
> 
> [jacob/7.9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.9?lang=eng#8)

### Name of Christ vs Mark of the Beast

If there are types on some things, perhaps it would stand to reason that there are types in most if not all other things.

So, a small mark of the beast could be the guilt on one's conscience for a misdeed.
Or, it could be a physical mark such as a tattoo or membership in a dark society. Good deeds would also have their converse mark of good.

Could a bio-chip be the mark of the beast? Sure, why not? But is it THE mark of the beast? That's up for debate.

Will there be some ultimate mark of the beast? I think so, but perhaps there will be precursors (shadows or types) of the marks of the beast which, if you notice early on, you'll be more prepared to identify the mark of the beast when / if it comes.

Is Covid-19 and the vaccine / ID2020 etc... the mark of the beast? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it's a mark *of some kind* and perhaps a type of the prophesied mark yet to come. By taking the mark on you, you signal that you have believed the narrative behind that mark. If it's the mark of the beast itself, you signal that you have taken upon you the name of that narrative.

Conversely, following Jesus Christ into the waters of baptism is a symbol, an ordinance:

> 10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?
> 
> [mosiah/18.10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.10?lang=eng#9)

And it leads to the ultimate good mark, which is taking the name of Christ upon yourself:

> 13 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
> 
> [2-ne/31.13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13?lang=eng#p13#13)

## Conclusion

Getting the prophecy exactly right I don't think matters so much as the act of watching itself matters. This enables one to take the name of Christ and avoid taking bad marks.

Watching the signs of the times helps one to know the seasons and motivates one to be better. Some [humble themselves in whatsoever circumstance they find themselves in.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.25?lang=eng#24) For others, watching the signs of the times helps them *see* what awful circumstance the world is in, helping them see how important it is to choose righteousness instead of wicknedness.

Thus, watching the signs of the times helps one come to Christ. So why be against others paying attention to these patterns? We're commanded to watch, after all, so that the 2nd Coming does not overtake us as does a thief in the night.

To reiterate, this process of watching and research is part of the benefit. For one begins to see how corrupt, subversive and deceptive the cunning designs of Satan are. One begins to see that the battle between good and evil is a real one. And one becomes polarized toward good.

**If ever a choice has to be made about whether to take the mark of the beast or not, one will be ready to see & refuse as they were watching and saw shadows and types in advance.**

So, don't get caught up in whether someone is right or wrong about a particular type or prophecy. They're watching! Engage with them on the merit of the idea itself.
