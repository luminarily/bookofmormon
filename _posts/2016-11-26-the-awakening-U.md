# Introduction

What you're about to learn will shock you. 

# To Trump Supporters and Fence Sitters Only

If you've taken the <span class="blue">blue pill</span>, leave.

**This blog post is for Trump supporters and those who are in the process of waking up.** People who are waking up realize they need to understand what is going on and are psychologically humbled and prepared to join the #TrumpTrain. This post is written with Mormons in mind, but it will apply to all #centipedes, *believe me.* :D

## Terminology

First, some terminology.

Trump supporters are generally referred to as "red-pilled". They are not hesitant to admit that the Establishment (and all its fronts) is corrupt. They know how deep the rabbit hole goes. Some anti-Trumpists generally have been "blue-pilled". Some have not taken either pill are ready to take the red pill. Some are not. As we learned in The Matrix, Neo's journey to being freed from the Matrix began with taking the red pill. What are the pills in the real world? Two *radically-different* and *juxtaposing* information sets.

This is why CNN, MSNBC, ABC, FOX, etc... tightly control the information they share and the spin they put on it.

## Disclaimer & Warning

If you are offended by this, you are not ready. [**Get out of here.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPbszPJPv5w) Come back when you have an open mind. No really, by continuing to read you risk **hardening your heart** even more. Please, turn back and come back when you are ready. Again, If you continue, you continue at **your own risk**.

Do NOT come complaining to me that what I wrote offended you. I am NOT attacking you personally or anyone for that matter. You came here and you are reading this anonymously. You alone are responsible for continuing and for the effect this content has on you. You have been warned.

I am assuming from this point my audience are Trump supporters or those who are ready to take the red pill with a Mormon emphasis.

Some of the information I share will be generally accepted in the Trump supporter community. Some of it is my perspective as a member of the LDS Church. These are my opinions. The reason I finally decided to write this is because over the past five years, I have understood the trajectory of society. I have suffered because I have felt like an outcast - believing in things which were generally dismissed by normal society. Often, I have been labeled a conspiracy theorist and just plain weird for what I believe. Boy, how I feel vindicated by Trump's victory. Trump's campaign has single-handedly turned the tables. I no longer feel I am in a minority, but rather part of a global movement of people who have awakened to the awful nature of our situation. More on that later.

As I was saying, over the past several years I have followed alternative news media (ANM). I was 100% aware that Trump had a very strong likelihood of winning. I was aware of the coup and counter-coup going on. All of this information was freely-available online for anyone who looked. But, as we know from scripture, for some even the [act of **looking**](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41?lang=eng) is too difficult. How the Mainstream Media (MSM) has been humbled! And how the ANM has been vindicated by Trump's victory! The ANM were the only ones aware of Trump's upcoming landslide. People who followed ANM were filled with joy when Trump won. Shouts of joy echoed across the United States from those who had been awakened by studying unpopular outlets of truth.

On the other side, the MSM and consequently the people who followed MSM were confident Trump would lose. Pride precedes the fall, and how true this was in the case of the MSM and those who believed the lies at their core! Fence-sitters were also hurt because they were somewhat deceived and they thought Trump was a horrible choice. On the contrary, Trump is not the lesser of two evils. NO ONE - and I mean NO ONE - could have done what Trump has done. Running for President and threatening the Establishment at the same time was a job requirements list NO ONE on this planet filled except Trump. From his billion-dollar fortune, to his boisterous personality, to his belief system, to his tactical method of dialog - he was a tactical nuke aimed at the evil and global secret combination. More on that later.

## Coming Out of the Cave

**We consume the information we believe and we believe the information we consume.**

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/f85oKS2.png" alt="Cave meme">

Memes were a powerful, viral force in spreading unpopular though true information. They did play a role in Trump's win as they served to educate "normies" on things they otherwise would be completely oblivious to.

For instance... some individuals changed their minds for who they were voting for after they saw this meme:

<img src="https://i.redditmedia.com/0wpbLajDyQh9boc0XhPPK37STG1xNUFYok-Spqpx_sU.jpg?w=750&s=28a2f13bb214c81677b98d5a2c66b173" alt="drafting_women_for_war">

You will find the coming months - and especially after inauguration day, the tune will change and the anti-Trumpers will begin to become aware of the fact that Trump is a good person and will be a great president. It's already happening due to Trump's first interview on 60 Minutes. Many feel Trump is irredeemable because of the audio recording of Trump. Imagine if someone released a recording of the two worst hours of your behavior. Would you be embarrassed? Humbled? Would you wish people would forgive you and give you another chance? You would. We are all guilty and we should not be so quick to judge. Trump has not been convicted of a crime.


Until then, the MSM is going to fight him with everything they got. They will continue to make normies (a normie someone who has not taken the red pill) think that Trump is a tyrant. They will continue to push the narrative that people in America are scared. They hate Trump because he does indeed represent a threat to their corrupt and exclusive business model. Don't ignore the gravity of the word "corrupt." Liars. Hypocrites. Conspirators. These people don't care if they murder, steal or deceive. All they care about is getting worldly gain and having power.

That is, unless we know we are being lied to. However, if we aren't suspicious, we trust the sources we go to for information. You *must* understand and accept this if you are to break free from the information echo chamber the MSM has constructed around you. Be humble and realize - no man is an island. Like a snowflake in water, we homogenize and become like the environment we are in (again, if we are not aware that we are being lied to.) The Founders of the United States were aware of this. This is precisely why they created the Electoral College: to protect minorities from majorities who share the same beliefs *simple because* they live in close proximity. The Founders were inspired geniuses. They didn't know it then, but the Electoral College has saved this country from certain destruction. Without it, the popular vote would have triumphed. As of this writing, since Hillary has more popular votes, she would have won. If Hillary won, the following things were almost certain to occur given enough time:

* Alternative news outlets would have been outlawed.
* The right to bear arms would have been abolished.
* Late-term and partial abortions would have become common place.
* The flood gates of immigration would open American soil to any culture and any belief system. Americanism would eventually be a thing of the past. The American Dream would be a relic lost to history. Don't think your beliefs can be easily transferred to immigrants. Beliefs are formed very early on in childhood and throughout the teenage years into young adulthood.
* The two-pronged approach of abortion (killing native-born) and open borders (allowing immigration on a massive scale) would lead to a complete breakdown of culture - and eventually, traditional values would be lost to history forever as the majority of immigrants vote democrat. Make no mistake, this was the last election for us to save the Republic and put a stop to these culture-destroying policies. If you feel your Facebook friends were overly passionate about waking people up, understand they felt like they were fighting for the very survival of the Republic. If your initial thought is "well, Hillary supporters thought they were fighting for the same thing!" - be patient, I will get to that.

If you haven't taken the red pill yet, you have been in a psychological cave. The cave is your world. Everything you know about the perplexities of nations and culture is within this cave. If you are still in this cave, it is because you either do not accept any "conspiracy theories" or because you have never heard anything in your life that challenged your environment.



## The Mark of a Liberal is... HYPOCRISY.

Do you know what the difference between God and Satan is?

Both Heavenly Father and Satan want:

* our will
* us in their kingdoms
* ultimate power
* control over eternal laws and our souls

Both Heavenly Father and Satan claim to provide:

* enlightenment and knowledge
* security
* rewards for following their commands

So, what is the difference between God and Satan in terms of what they offer and what they want? Why do you think there are satanists out there? Satan's argument must be a logical argument for people to jump on board because we are rational beings. We follow things that we *think* make sense. We follow authority that we trust.

It seems you could almost argue Heavenly Father and Satan are the same based on what they want. Ahh... but for one key difference. Satan is a hypocrite and a liar. God is not. Now, everyone to some extent has been hypocritical in their life - but once you engage in enough hypocritical and dishonest behavior, you might just earn yourself the label of a hypocrite. That's what Satan has done.

How can you tell a liberal? How do you know? Use the same litmus test to tell the difference between good and evil: do they engage in consistent hypocritical behavior? Liberal they are.

**The mark of a liberal progressive is hypocrisy.**

Paul Joseph Watson does a good job [illustrating this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d9lm-T87AQ)

In no particular order, here are some examples of hypocrisy...

* Hillary prides herself on gay rights, yet takes money from a country which murders gays.
* Hillary criticized Donald Trump as being a threat to democracy for not wanting to say he accepts the results of the election. However, as of 11/12, she has said nothing to the rioters who are beating people, shooting guns at people, destroying property, etc... all while chanting "not my president!". This is MASSIVE hypocrisy. Indeed, the liberal shows their true selves when they don't get their way. Where was the mass rioting in 2008 and 2012 from the conservatives?? NOWHERE.
* Liberals want to ban guns from the lower echelons of the population. It's ok for Rosie O'Donnell to have armed bodyguards and for the Government to have as many guns as it needs, but it is not ok for the population to have guns. We know Government is ruled by imperfect people capable of corruption. The only thing standing between them and our freedom is our guns.
* Hillary Clinton and her liberal supporters accused Trump supporters as being violent. Yet, we know through WikiLeaks and Project Veritas, that the Clinton campaign hired a 3rd party group with the specific instruction of inciting violence at Trump rallies. If you only followed MSM, you would have formed a strong opinion in your mind (which you *must* now reverse) that it was Trump supporters that were instigating this. Hypocrisy. Hypocrisy. Hypocrisy.
* Obama said he wanted a transparent government and yet, time and time again, we see through the WikiLeaks, there is correspondence between him and and illegal email server under Hillary Clinton's control. The credo of a liberal is "do as I say, not as I do. In fact, just completely ignore what I do. Let's talk about you and how you're completely wrong because I said so and put a label on your face."
* Liberals blame conservatives for racism. They blame them for xenophobia. And yet, why is it that the only legal form of racism is against whites? Why is it that the racial divides in this country have EXPLODED since Obama (the 'Race' President) got in office? Why? Because they're hypocrites. They are the ones *causing* the racism through their divisive groups such as Black Lives Matter. ALL lives matter.
* AND - here's the kicker - when a liberal is faced with an argument they cannot dispute, they will call you a name or reduce you down to an adjective with no supporting arguments. How did the DNC respond to WikiLeaks?? How did the MSM respond to WikiLeaks?? Did they report on the CONTENT of the emails at all? Did they care? No. They responded by immediately BLAMING Russia for the leak itself. Liberals don't want you to share information that contradicts their viewpoint - period. It offends them. 
* Liberals want their 'safe space' and demand others respect it; however, they think nothing of the safe spaces of those with opposing viewpoints. Because of this, a society full of liberals means a society where the outside air is their safe space. Conservatives are driven to be terrified of speaking their mind in a liberal society.
* They are tolerant of any viewpoint - just not conservatives.
* They accuse Trump of being a demagogue: according to [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=demagogue+definition&oq=demagogue+def&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3098j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) "a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument." Remember: hypocrisy. If we are to apply this litmus test to said definition, we will find that Hillary is the real demagogue.

I think you get the picture. TRUE Liberals (like the ones involved in the riots) are extremely hypocritical individuals. I interact with people who are not liberals, but are on the left. How do I know they are not liberals? Because they exhibit about the same amount of hypocrisy as the average Joe, such as myself.

### Fence-sitters are not liberals!

Often Mormons who are still on the fence are offended by criticisms of liberals who supported Hillary. News flash! WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU. How do I know? Believe me, hypocrites are easy to spot and you are definitely not a hypocrite. You are polarized against Trump because of how the media has focused on his statements and how they have often spun his words.

Don't get me wrong, Trump has his flaws and has said some outrageous things. There is something you need to understand - what Trump did was a heroic feat. Do you think that was by accident? What if I told you that some of the inflammatory things Trump said *helped* him win? If Trump was not an eccentric and strong personality, he could not have won. Consider - he just got hired for the most competitive job in the world through a year and a half interview process. He had to convince hundreds of millions of people by choosing his words for over 500 days - hundreds of thousands of words to be chosen in response to capable opponents. Do you remember the RNC debates? Trump DECIMATED the competition. This guy, love him or hate him, knows what he's doing and he knows how to take on the most threatening opponents. He is not to be trifled with. Don't make the same mistake as Obama, the WhiteHouse and the National Media - they underestimated his abilities.

My point is, you are probably turned off by Trump because of things he's said and/or because of the MSM. First of all, the MSM has proven they know JACK SQUAT - boy how wrong they were about the election!!! - so, you have to look at the things he said. The more you ponder this, the more you will realize - Trump was probably the only person on the whole planet who could have pulled this off. He had the temperament, the disruptive and even offensive personality to garner attention and coverage, and he had billions of dollars so that no other man could control him. However, he respects our military and will heed their council. He will not be a dictator. He's demonstrating that he can be very presidential and there are checks and balances in place in our government. We the people and the government officials will keep an eye on him. Ironically, he will probably be the best president we've had since Washington. He will be firm, because to #draintheswamp, he needs to be. There are people that need to be humbled and removed from positions of power.

TL;DR: Trump's temperament, wordsmithing, wealth, intelligence, courage, values and yes, his imperfections as well, are like the secret code to the self-destruct sequence of the Great and Spacious Building.

The election was about much more than just policy. It was about corruption. The <span class="blue">blue pillers</span> believe what the MSM (MSM) has told them. There is no corruption. Hillary was completely innocent. MSM ignores WikiLeaks. MSM ignores undercover operation like Project Veritas.

To be clear, there may be exceptions, but in my experience you cannot understand the Trump movement without paying attention to and understanding what went on with Project Veritas. You cannot understand the Trump movement without paying attention to WikiLeaks. Why? Because, if you don't understand the depth of political corruption going on, you will think that Hillary is completely innocent and that all accusations against her are imaginary. Why? Because the MSM has told you so. "No they didn't, I came up with that myself." Bull. You watch the news because you believe it. The information hypnosis is subtle. You might think your thoughts are original because you use different grammar or vocabulary than the reporters - but make no mistake, the course of your thoughts are dictated by the dialog you have subjected yourself to day to day. We can and do have original thought, but for things we have no firsthand knowledge of, we make conclusions based on the experience relayed by others - whether they are lying or not doesn't matter. What matters is whether or not we trust them.

Trust speeds up indoctrination. We all engage in indoctrination every day, there's no question about that. The question is which indoctrination we choose.

Did you know that it's common for prime time MSM news reporters to make over 10 million dollars per year? Some make over 20 million. If their boss says, "Tonight you're going to report on this and I want it said in this way," do you think they're going to argue? You're damn right they won't. They will report what and how they're told. The Reddit community supporting Donald Trump describes them as "robots." They themselves are programmed to program their viewers. WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CALLED "PROGRAMMING"? Hiding in plain sight, our propagandists lie.


I was so appreciative of the [Neal Silvester blog](https://nealsilvester.wordpress.com/) for posting [this article](https://nealsilvester.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/the-real-reason-for-trumps-mormon-wall/). It helped me understand the case against Trump from the Mormon perspective.

I thought I would provide the same courtesy to provide an overview as to why I, as a Mormon, support Donald J. Trump. I'm not a seasoned blog writer like Neal, but I'll do my best.

If you live in Utah, you no doubt have experienced the tumultous battleground on Facebook. Trump supporters and McMullin supporters are bringing their cases and debating during this critical time. Of course, there is some fighting, but it's better to have a small tiff on Facebook than to not speak at all! Otherwise, we cannot know each others' minds. This is part of the process of human synchronization. Let's have this discussion and get on the same page.

Stick with me. I promise, I'll be respectful and I'll try to be entertaining. But for you to understand the Mormon Trump supporter, there are some things you need to understand first. Trust me - if you understand these things, you'll be *aware* of the Trump supporter and why they feel the way they do. You won't necessarily agree, but at least you'll understand.

### Difference between the Trump and McMullin supporter (likely fence-sitter)

Before I dive into details behind the reasoning of a Trump supporter, I'd like to preface it by explaining some possible psychological propensities Trump supporters and McMullin supporters might differ on.

This is purely my opinion based on my experience on Facebook, so please do take it with a grain of salt. Traits are not necessarily good or bad - just different with different effects.

1. Trump supporters seem to have a higher propensity to question leadership and authority.
2. McMullin supporters seem more apt to understand the value of leadership and authority.
3. Trump supporters seem to be a little more rambunctious and maybe even a little rebellious.
4. McMullin supporters seem less outspoken and more submissive - and maybe even more meek than Trump supporters.
5. Trump supporters seem to be extremely ready for a massive correction of the entire system.
6. McMullin supporters seem to also want the system fixed, but don't want anything too drastic.
7. Trump supporters seem more ready to criticize systems - be it the government or corporations.
8. McMullin supporters seem more trusting of the government and corporations.
9. Trump supporters seem extremely distrusting of MSM corporations.
10. McMullin supporters seem more supportive of mainstream news outlets.

These are just a few items. Bear in mind, as I said - there are not good and bad traits.

The two camps can learn from each other I believe - and I believe they will only learn from eachother when they understand one another.

For instance, I think Trump supporters can learn something from the McMullin camp about respect for leadership and authority and think McMullin supporters can learn something from the Trump camp about questioning harmful programs and systems.

Keep that in mind - if you are a McMullin supporter, the purpose of this post if to give you the Trump supporter's perspective. Please, keep an open mind and heart. If you are a Trump supporter, make sure you read that other blog post about McMullin to gain the other perspective.

# Before I begin...

Now that you know my objective, please suspend offense and open your mind as I did for Neal's post.

I will be sharing a lot of information that will seem "crazy" at first. I've spent years with my head in this stuff; there's a lot of information. I will try to provide links to other sources if you would like to dive into a particular topic in greater detail. Otherwise, please at least temporarily assume that what I am saying is true - then, please google and research those elements you disagree with. Again, this post is to help you to understand perspective.

This is why I, as a Mormon, support Donald Trump.

Let's begin.

# Secret Combinations

Like McMullin supporters, in the mind of a Mormon Trump supporter, secret combinations are a very real thing. The world knows secret combinations by the name of conspiracies. Conspiracies are when people plot to harm others. Unlike McMullin supporters who believe Trump is the threat and the one who is conspiring to harm the American people, Trump supporters believe that the American people have already been horribly harmed by the 'establishment'.

Contrasted to McMullin supporters to believe Trump is the combination out to destroy the country, Trump supporters believe the conspiracies and secret combinations have already reached a boiling point. For me, this is because I have been following these things for several years and Trump is the first popular candidate who is standing up to what I've seen as combinations poised to destroy our freedom.

## General Examples

* Extreme bias in MSM.
* Corruption in politicians.
* Corruption in large companies.
* Costs of living
* Costs of education
* Healthcare costs
* Foreign wars and fiscal

These are general examples and elements. To the Trump supporter, Trump challenges all of these things. Isn't it evident with the support he's not receiving from big business, big media and big government?

* [No CEOs at Fortune 100 Companies Are Backing Donald Trump](http://fortune.com/2016/09/24/fortune-100-companies-donald-trump/)
* [56 Major business leaders endorse Hillary Clinton](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/business-leaders-endorse-hillary-clinton-224706)
* [WikiLeaks exposes media's secret support of Clinton](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/12/bias-alert-wikileaks-exposes-medias-secret-support-clinton.html)
* [Barack Obama slams Trump, makes appeal for Hillary Clinton](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/27/politics/president-obama-democratic-convention-speech/)

You gotta wonder - isn't it interesting that those in power and those with money, the elite of our society, are so utterly opposed to Trump? What is it, exactly, about his policies that has them so opposed?

The example 

What are the evidences of this harm? There are so many and it can get complicated, but I will name a few.

* Americans fought and died in Iraq to stop weapons of mass destruction. People died and none were found. http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7634313/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/cias-final-report-no-wmd-found-iraq/
* Americans have been lied to in the most nefarious ways by Obama. Here's a list of 1,063 documented cases of Obama lying to the American public: http://freedomoutpost.com/1063-documented-examples-of-barack-obamas-lying-lawbreaking-corruption-cronyism-hypocrisy-waste-etc/

The Book of Mormon is clear on secret combinations: they are real.
On December 23, 1913, the Federal Reserve was created. Hold in your mind the thought that the Federal Reserve is a private entity which prints paper money - at the cost of printing - which the rest of the populace depends on for their needs. Indeed, you cannot run a business in the U.S. without using this currency.

The Federal Reserve is owned by a small group of super rich individuals who stay far away from public view. We as Mormon's view the Earth's landscape and marvel at "how we came to be" - us viewing the earth as the workmanship of the Lord's hands. At the same time, I wonder - how did the Federal Reserve come to be? How did the fundamental building blocks that make up our society come to be? I.E. paper cash, insurance, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, law firms, computers, cars, etc... Because I have a higher propensity to question systems, even the Federal Reserve is not above questioning. Indeed, Ron Paul said we needed to "end the Fed", saying that we have terrible fiscal policy because of the Fed.
