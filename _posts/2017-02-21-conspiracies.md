The Book of Mormon teaches that conspiracies are real and are a legitimate threat to freedom.

# Do you know why the Nephite nation was destroyed?

> 19 For the Lord worketh not in **secret combinations**, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man.
> 
> 20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.
> 
> 21 **And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.**
> 
> [Ether 8:19-21][7] (Book of Mormon)

<sub>Note: "Secret combination" is a term used in the Book of Mormon that means conspiracy.</sub>

If that wasn't cautionary enough, we are further warned that there is a secret combination setup among the kingdoms of the gentiles that is *powerful enough to threaten the freedom of the entire planet*.

> 23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get power and gain—and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be.
>
> 24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall **awake to a sense of your awful situation**, because of **this secret combination** which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.
>
> 25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth **it** up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of **all** lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of **all** people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.
> 
> [Ether 8:23-25][18] (Book of Mormon)

We are counseled, and I believe **commanded**, to not allow secret combinations to get above us. Furthermore, we are informed that there is one Secret Combination in particular that has amassed enough power, through deception, subterfuge and force, to threaten the freedom of not only one country, but in fact that of the entire planet.

There is a dangerous tendency to dismiss any organized conspiracy through abstract attribution to Satan *alone*. **This minimizes earthly organization and form, exhonerating wordly institutions of any potential wrong-doing**). 

While Satan is the head of his church, many don't realize that he has set up earthly bureaucracies and taken control of armies.

### Everyone is a part of these systems ("in the world") whether aware of it or not. <br>Until seen for what they are, one risks being agents of those systems ("of the world")

These secret combinations were upheld through **specific** actions / oaths of mortal men and women. They didn't just "coalesce" out of the ether of Outer Darkness into a non-definable form. No, [secret combinations have specific forms][4] - albeit in secret and darkness, for darkness is the corrupt soil from which they sprout.

**The Book of Mormon refers to secret combinations / conspiracies [26 times][8].** That's 26 times we're counseled in the Book of Mormon essentially to not dismiss conspiracies, but to take them seriously as if our very freedoms depended on fighting and overcoming them. 

Though this may be extremely difficult to understand for some, this is EXACTLY what the American Gentiles were doing when they voted Trump on election day.

## We voted against the "false song of globalism". We voted against the New World Order. We voted against the Secret Combination that seeks the overthrow of all world democracies. The fight continues at the state and county level as individuals are learning to discern the honest from the deceitful.

Can you imagine posting this on your social media account? I think it's very telling how there's a palpable hostility against those who voted Trump and a fear to express conservative views.

It continues to be common for Mormons to dismiss any claim of conspiracy as simply a theory without merit.

Don't think you're open to the reality of conspiracies now that Trump has been elected. You can't say you suddenly have the vision to see conspiracies when for the past five or ten years you've denied their existence or simply ignored the possibility. You may think you're justified because of what the media has told you.

### Not realizing *how bad things were* before 2016, it's hard to understand why most American counties chose how they did November 8th, 2016.

# Why are secret combinations dismissed as conspiracy theories when the Book of Mormon explicitly warns us us about them?

Perhaps it stems from the notion that obedience is the [first law of heaven][1]. Because obedience to God's law and to his ordained authorities on the earth is valued, I think there is a tendency among some to project this reverence for authority on to *worldy authorities*. Although we obey the law of the land, that doesn't mean we necessarily trust any worldly institution that bears worldly authority - - - *\*cough\* big pharma* *\*cough\* career politicians* *\*cough\* etc...* - - - to always do things in our best interests and to always tell us the truth.

#### There is great risk in discovering this too late.

For one could put good for evil and evil for good by thinking the good guys are the bad guys and vice versa.

Prior to the election of Donald Trump, many were of the feeling that all was well in Zion when it wasn't. When Trump was elected, the world had "fallen apart". It is natural to vilify those who upend our worlds, even if our worlds were messed up.

> 21 And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: **All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well**—*and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell*.
> 
> [2nd Nephi 28:21][19] (Book of Mormon)

I can see how some reading this may assume that Trump is now the conspiracy that we must fight and take down. However, this is mistake. Being [quick to observe][2] is not an easy choice, as one becomes keenly and painfully aware.

Unfortunately, if one wakes up too late, there is a risk of waking up "on the wrong side of the bed", being confused as to what is good and what is evil. Satan is a master of deception. Consider - the country is at more than just a political divide. Truly, we are at an ideological divide. But, we cannot pass judgment on whether people are "worthy Christians" because the deception runs very deep and we are taught that 

> 24 they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
> 
> [Isaiah 29:24][5] (Bible)

So, it's not our place to pass defining judgment, but we can and should judge light from dark; the Book of Mormon [tells us how][6].

If you are to understand the year 2016 and why America chose Donald Trump - despite the condemnations of virtually every establishment sector, you *must* understand: things were bad - **really bad** - and mainly due to the Secret Combination that was (and is) undermining our democracy and our freedom.

If you are not aware of these workings in darkness, and you do not seek to understand them at least a little, then it seems only natural to hate Trump and think his supporters have lost their minds.

This is not the be-all, end-all - this is <i><b>*a piece*</b></i> of the puzzle in taking the red pill to wake up to our awful situation.

We are [commaned][20] to awaken to our awful situation. Now, thankfully it's finally all out in the open.

Here are some other things to look into.

* [Secret Combination Movie / Mormon Prophetic Warnings][21]
* [Federal Reserve][9]
* [Bilderberg Group][10]
* [9/11 BYU professor speaks out][11]
* [9/11 Loose Change][12]
* [Trilateral Commission][13]
* [Birth Certificate - Does the world claim you?][14]
* [The Story of Your Enslavement][15]
* [Big Pharma, turning humans into slaves][16]
* [Adam Freeland - WE WANT YOUR SOUL][17]

Don't buy into the notions..

* "If stuff like that was going on, we'd know it about it."
* "If they knew more, they would tell us!"
* "The government wouldn't lie to us."
* "The media wouldn't lie."
* "I don't trust anything but reputable, mainstream news outlets."

Don't be naive. Corruption seeks money, power and evasion of consequence at *any* cost.

##### The Nephite nation was destroyed by secret combinations - conspiracies.

# Why do you think the mainstream media calls any conspiracy a theory?

Psychological inoculation against truth. And that is the truth.

Sure, there are some theories out there that are way off-target. But, to dismiss everything the media labels as a conspiracy theory is lazy at best.

Conspiracies exist, and we must wake up from the slumber with which mainstream media entrances us and grasp the *context of reality* if we are to see things as they are and be armed with the necessary knowledge to preserve our freedom.
