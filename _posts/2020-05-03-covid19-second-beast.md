# Is CoronaVirus / COVID-19 the second Beast of Revelation?

Part of Beast Model #1, could it be that COVID-19 is the second beast of revelation?

I think a compelling case can be made that it is, for several reasons, not the least of which how well it fits into the first beast within Beast Model #1.


> 11 And I beheld another beast coming up **out of the earth**; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
> 
> 12 And he **exerciseth all the power of the first beast** before him, and **causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast**, whose deadly wound was healed.
> 
> [Revelation 13:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13.11-12?lang=eng#10)

## It came up out of the earth

The beast came up out of the earth. Covid, being biological, came out of the "dust" of the earth. This is in contrast to the first beast coming out of the sea (perhaps, meaning the liquidity of the financial system.)

## It exercised all power of the first beast.

Covid is enabling the first beast to enact long-standing agendas (such as justifying mass vaccinations, surveillance, etc...)
Despite the fact that the "white hats" & the military have regained much power back in washington, covid seems to be enabling the cabal to simple circumvent Trump & the Military and further the globalist agenda!

## It causes everyone to worship the first beast.


The U.S. economy was roaring before Covid hit. We were succeeding as a country in taking out much of the corruption, criminal rings, etc... and people were waking up. But once Covid hit, even if people had woken up to the corruption, they were forced to "worship" the first beast. Just a few examples:

- 24/7 surveillance on *everyone* monitoring things such as how close you are to another person (via ground cameras, drones, etc...)
- Mandatory vaccinations (which contain formaldehyde, and other nasties)
- Citations and arrests for play dates, and any other social distancing violations
- Mail-in ballot voting (election integrity forever compromised)
- Economical and financial ruin of millions
- Even Trump (remember, in this model he is one of the main reasons the head of the first beast was wounded) and his cabinet are forced to go along with the Covid narrative in how they interface with it, portray themselves to the public, etc...

"It **causes** everyone to worship the first beast." That's forceful language as if meaning people had stopped worshiping the first beast. This suggests that the wound of the first beast and people not worshiping it might be the same thing, if not closely related.

## 666 Microsoft Patent

This, perhaps, is one of the most curious and compelling coincidences.
In wake of coronavirus, Bill Gates has come out in strong support of vaccines as the only way out of the crisis.
Microsoft, Bill Gate's company recently submitted a patent with the number, wait for it, 060606, zeroes omitted, 666.

Go to https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/search.jsf
Search `WO2020060606`

```
A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user. ... if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.
```

WO can be omitted and 2020 is the year. A1 is perhaps a version number. What's left if 060606, and the zeroes can be omitted. 666 is what we're left with.

The filing date of this patent is 3/26/2020... during the CV pandemic. The timing is curious, the positions of Bill Gates, etc...

Many are speculating at this point due the patent number and some of its characteristics, it could be a viable candidate for a physical mark of the beast. Adding to that coronavirus being the second beast, Bill Gates activism with respect to CV and the patent being Microsoft's, add yet another dot to this possibility that COVID-19 / CoronaVirus is the second beast as described in Revelation.

Microsoft, about 2 years ago, stated that it reserved the right to remove any person using its private data storage service if they discovered any information that resembled "hate speech". The teachings of Jesus himself would be considered hate speech in today's political climate. I, for one, would be a bit uneasy if not downright defiant to accepting Microsoft as my behavior monitor.
