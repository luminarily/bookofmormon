##### The Bible warns us to support Israel or **be destroyed.**

> 9 ¶And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:9][1]

# Israel is not Jerusalem, though... right?

> 6 ¶In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and **Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.**
> 
> [Zechariah 12:6][2]

The Bible is making clear here - the governers of the tribe of Judah, or the rulers of the Jews, shall return to the geographical location of Jerusalem. Israel is the country of the Jews and Jerusalem is their capital.

# Isn't Israel the aggressor? How can we be supportive of such a country?

Let's see what the Lord thinks about Israel and Jerusalem.

> 1 The burden of the **word of the Lord for Israel**, saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:1][3]

These *are* the words of the Lord regarding Israel.

> 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a **cup of trembling unto all the people round about**, when they shall be in the **siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem**.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:2][4]

What is the "cup of trembling"? In [Isaiah 51:22][12] we learn that the "cup of trembling" are the "dregs" of the cup of the Lord's fury. Thus, we can see that those nations, people and politicians that lay siege to Jerusalem and the Jews will face the Lord's fury.

Put another way:

> 3 ¶And in that day will I make Jerusalem a **burdensome stone** for all people: all that *burden themselves with it* shall be **cut in pieces**, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:3][5]

Nations that "burden" themselves with Jerusalem will be "cut in pieces." How do they burden themselves with Jerusalem? They align themselves *against* Israel.

##### Those that hate the Jews, their right to their capitol of Jerusalem and take it upon themselves to fight against Israel *will be cut in pieces*.

> 4 In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:4][6]

I think the above verse is referring to the politicians and public figures who align themselves against Israel will be overcome with a maddening, hostile and blind hatred. This will naturally lead to self-destructive decision-making which will lead to public humiliation and unadulterated hate and anger on the part of the "horses."

> 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The **inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength** in the Lord of hosts their God.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:5][7]

I interpret this to mean that the Israeli politicians will remember the will of the people and their faith in God. This will 'bind' God to answer their prayers - for as they look to Him, He will look to them and fulfill His promises.

> 6 ¶In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an **hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.**
> 
> [Zechariah 12:6][8]

This is vivid imagery that describes exactly what we are witnessing **before our very eyes**. Israel has become like a burning ember, searing the nations around it. This is due to **opposing ideologies coupled with military might**. Because of prophecy, we know how this will culminate in the war of Armageddon (which deserves a post of its own).

> 7 The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:7][9]

I think this means that the Lord is promising the Jews that He will protect the outlying settlements and not allow them to be overrun due the ambitions of the Jews to possess Jerusalem. This may mean that prior to possessing Jerusalem, Israel will be made to compromise so that it's population be spared a premature war. Benjamin Netanyahu's [press briefing][13] on Feb. 15th. 2017, where Donald Trump told him to "hold off on settlements" comes to mind.

> 8 In that day shall the Lord **defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem**; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them.
> 
> [Zechariah 12:8][10]

#### Don't mess with a country that shall be "as God" and where the "feeble among them" are as David - able to take on enemies many times their size.

Consider the female Israeli soldier Ben-Yehuda was able to [hold off 23 terrorists in a "surprise attack"][14] *after having been shot*. Sounds like a modern David against a Goliath of men to me.

> 9 ¶And it shall come to pass in that day, that **I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.**
> 
> [Zechariah 12:9][11]

### Our Lord, and Creator who has all power says He will *actively seek* to destroy offenders of Jerusalem. I don't know about you, but I for one don't want to harbor hostility toward Jerusalem!

This discussion of Zechariah 12 leads to an interesting hypothesis:

## Politicians and their stance toward Israel can function as a sort of **"litmus test"** on whether we should support them may even help us to determine whether or not we should cast our vote for them.

A litmus test is a test where a chemically-infused piece of paper changes color based on the alkalinity or acidity of the liquid it is exposed to. The color of the paper indicates where on the PH-scale the liquid falls. This is a **simple test** to observe and **even measure an otherwise unmeasurable, non-visible quality.**

# Does a politican support Israel? <br>Yes: Support the politician. <br>No: Don't support the politician.

# Q: But why does America go out of her way to support Israel?

Good question - one that can be easily answered by scripture. Let's look at this from a scriptural perspective and not from how Israel has "strong-armed" our politicians to support them in the past. Remember, we are in a war, and in war there is deception by Satan and his followers, and strategy by God and His followers. It is not sin to win by strategem. Meaning, if Israel has dirt on our politicians (which they may), I would not be so quick to condemn Israel for using that intelligence to their benefit.

Back to the question. Let's look at another scripture:

> 12 ¶Turn you to the strong hold, ye **prisoners of hope:** even to day do I declare that I will **render double unto thee;**
> 13 When I have bent Judah for me, **filled the bow with Ephraim**, and raised up thy sons, **O Zion**, *against* thy sons, **O Greece**, and made thee as the **sword of a mighty man**.
> 14 And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the **Lord God shall blow the trumpet**, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.
> 
> [Zechariah 9:12-14][14]

These verses are packed, and I interpret them thus -

We have been in bondage for some time in America, yet we took a chance on an unorthodox man because we believed he offered us our only hope out of our awful situation. I believe that under Donald Trump, the Lord will render great prosperity to America.

Now, to the interesting part and the part where I believe revealed Mormon doctrine clarifies this verse greatly. The house of Judah is comprised mostly of Israel and the Jews. So, who is Ephraim??

## "In the great majority of cases, Latter-day Saints are of the tribe of Ephraim, the tribe to which has been committed the leadership of the Latter-day work. Whether this lineage is of blood or adoption it does not matter." - Elder John A. Widtsoe (Apostle) ([Source][15]).

Many of the members of the Church in the United States are of the tribe of Ephraim. I think we can reasonably conclude that there are many individuals in the United States who are of the tribe of Ephraim - that is, by blood and not adoption. I believe these individuals feel a calling, a compelling force within them, to seek to bolster the latter-day work and advance the agenda of prayers past and God's will.

I think it is likely that Donald Trump is of the house of Ephraim or of the house of Manasseh.

There are some prominent individuals in Washington who are Mormons who are advancing the cause of truth by exposing conspiracies and standing for the right.
