###### Opposition In All Things

Don't think there is a Great Awakening happening?

David Rodriguez, a World Heavy Weight Champion boxer said the following in a YouTube interview on May 5th, 2020:

```
If there's darkness, it has to have an exact polar opposite. Light needs dark. Dark needs light. You can't have light without dark. They need eachother. It's Yin and Yang. ... Then that goes into the discussion of like ok 'what's really right and wrong?' It all comes down to perception. But, I think as human beings, we are light beings. There's an old indian proverb that says internally we always have two wolves fighting: the white wolf and the black wolf; the bad and the good and which one wins.. it's the one that you feed the most. So, that goes back to.. it's a choice! That's what free will comes down to. And that's what I've been battling with. Like, it's really a conscious choice to think 'ok, am I going to go this way or this way? No.. if I go this way I know what can happen, I know where that leads me, I'm going to go this way... I'm going to choose to feed the white wolf'. Now, a lot of people feed the dark wolf and those come in forms of vices. ... You gotta also remember this: there is a beauty in darkness. There's a transformation that happens in darkness. The darkness I went through in my life, it lead to the light. ... Plants need darkness as much as they need sun. They have to coexist.
```

Compare his statement with the Book of Mormon verse:

> 11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.

Perhaps you've been a life-long member of the Church. If you were asked to put the above verse in your own words, do you think you could have done a better job than David?

I do not know if he's ever read the Book of Mormon, but I find his words remarkable - he was a heavyweight champion and came out of a dark place in drinking addiction (paraphrasing). Out of that, he found doctrine within his heart closely resembling the language of scripture.

There is truly a #GreatAwakening taking place. People are finding doctrinal nuggets through YouTube videos and by observing the corresponding evil. Indeed, many are coming to Christ as they are discovering evil for the first time.

### Light Comprehends Darkness, Yet Does Not Yield

I personally believe that light comprehends darkness, yet does not yield.

As General Michael Flynn said at the republican national convention:

```
[We] should not fear our enemies. In fact, we should clearly define our enemies. Face them head on, and then defeat those that seek to threaten [us]. ... Our way of life is in jeopardy, our very existence is threatened. What keeps me up at night is the sobering realization that evil exists.
```

<div class="b cb1">
God comprehends *all* things.
</div>

> 35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.

<div class="b cb1">
Christ descended below all things, thus He understands all things (even darkness itself)
</div>

> 5 Which glory is that of the church of the Firstborn, even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus Christ his Sonâ€”
> 
> 6 He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth;

<div class="b cb1">
In the Bible, darkness did not comprehend light. Since Christ is the Light and Christ comprehends all things, it can be inferred that Light indeed comprehends darkness.
</div>

> 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
> 
> 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
> 
> 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

## Light Frees, Darkness Captivates

> 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
> 
> [John 8:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.32?lang=eng&clang=eng#p32)

> 5 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.
> 
> 6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.
> 
> [Alma 12:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.5-6?lang=eng&clang=eng#4)

> 27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.
> 
> [2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#26)

> 26 And he beheld Satan; and he had a great chain in his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the earth with darkness; and he looked up and laughed, and his angels rejoiced.

> [Moses 7:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.26?lang=eng#26)

Chains and darkness.

It all boils down to [choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FToHabxSVYg).

The human will is the *last* frontier. God chose to preserve our agency (ability to choose). And so, light and dark exist and it's up to us which one we choose.
