I"B6<h5 id="the-book-of-mormon-teaches-that-conspiracies-are-real-massive-deliberate-and-dangerous">The Book of Mormon teaches that conspiracies are real, massive, deliberate, and dangerous.</h5>

<p>Mormons are taught, by their own scripture, to <strong>believe</strong> in conspiracies - that they are real and that they are a legitimate threat to freedom. In fact, we are taught <em>by our own scripture</em> that there is a secret combination - a New World Order - (note the <em>singular</em> use of the word in the below verse) setup among the kingdoms of the gentiles that is powerful enough to enslave the planet.</p>

<h6 id="secret-combinations-is-a-term-used-in-the-book-of-mormon-to-describe-organized-malicious-conspiracies-among-individuals-who-seek-goals-which-harm-others">“Secret combinations” is a term used in the Book of Mormon to describe organized, malicious conspiracies among individuals who seek goals which harm others.</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and <strong>suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you</strong>, which are built up to get power and gain—and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be.</p>

  <p>24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall <strong>awake to a sense of your awful situation</strong>, because of <strong>this secret combination</strong> which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.</p>

  <p>25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth <strong>it</strong> up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of <strong>all</strong> lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of <strong>all</strong> people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We are counseled to not allow secret combinations to get above us. Furthermore, we are informed that there is one Secret Combination in particular that has amassed enough power, through deception, subterfuge and force, to threaten the freedom of not only one country, but in fact that of the entire planet.</p>

<p>Ponder that for a time.</p>

<p>I’ve observed a tendency among my fellow Mormons to dismiss conspiracy through attributing it all to Satan (<strong>thus minimizing earthly organization and form, absolving mortal institutions and technologies of any guilt</strong>). While Satan is the head of his church, many don’t realize that Satan has setup earthly bureaucracies and armies interwoven among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>A related question illustrates the importance of recognizing the tell-tale signs of conspiracies and secret combinations.</p>

<h1 id="q-what-eventually-lead-to-the-entire-destruction-of-the-people-of-nephi-in-the-book-of-mormon">Q: What eventually lead to the entire destruction of the people of Nephi in the Book of Mormon?</h1>

<h2 id="a-secret-combinations-in-particular-conspiracies-at-the-head-of-government">A: Secret Combinations (in particular, conspiracies at the head of government.)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>19 For the Lord worketh not in <strong>secret combinations</strong>, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man.</p>

  <p>20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.</p>

  <p>21 <strong>And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>These secret combinations were upheld through <strong>specific</strong> actions / oaths of mortal men and women. They didn’t just coalesce out of the ether of Outer Darkness into a non-definable form. No, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.20?lang=eng#20">secret combinations have specific forms</a> - albeit in secret and darkness.</p>

<p><strong>The Book of Mormon refers to secret combinations / conspiracies <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/search?lang=eng&amp;type=verse&amp;query=combination">26 times</a>.</strong> That’s 26 times we’re counseled in the Book of Mormon essentially to not dismiss conspiracies, but to take them seriously as if our very freedoms depended on fighting and overcoming them.</p>

<p>This is EXACTLY what the Gentiles were doing when they voted Trump on election day.</p>

<h4 id="we-voted-against-the-false-song-of-globalism-we-voted-against-the-new-world-order-we-voted-against-the-secret-combination-that-seeks-the-overthrow-of-all-world-democracies">We voted against the “false song of globalism”. We voted against the New World Order. We voted against the Secret Combination that seeks the overthrow of all world democracies.</h4>

<p>Can you imagine posting this on your social media account? I think it’s very telling how there’s a palpable hostility against those who voted Trump.</p>

<p>It continues to be common for Mormons to dismiss any claim of conspiracy as simply a theory without merit.</p>

<p>Don’t think you’re open to the reality of conspiracies now that Trump has been elected. You can’t say you suddenly have the vision to see conspiracies when for the past five or ten years you’ve denied their existence or simply ignored the possibility. You may think you’re justified because of what the media has told you.</p>

<p>How can Mormons dismiss conspiracies when their own Book of Mormon explicitely teaches them to accept their reality AND even to take action against them?</p>

<p>I posit two main reasons, though I am sure there are many more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mormon’s believe that obedience is the <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-for-exaltation-teachers-manual/lesson-23-obedience-the-first-law-of-heaven?lang=eng">first law of heaven</a>. Because they value obedience - to God’s law and to his ordained authorities on the earth - I think there is a tendency among some to project this reverence for authority on to <em>worldy authorities</em>. This is incorrect. Although we obey the law of the land, that doesn’t mean we necessarily trust any worldy instution that bears wordly authority - - - <em>*cough* big pharma</em> <em>*cough* career politicians</em> <em>*cough* etc…</em> - - - to always do things in our best interests and to always tell us the truth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the election of Donald Trump, many were of the feeling that all was well in Zion and that more of the same was better than what Trump had to offer. Because of their feeling that was well, now that Trump is president, it’s a natural consequence to feel that everything has fallen apart.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>21 And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: <strong>All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well</strong>—<em>and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21?lang=eng#20">2nd Nephi 28:21</a> (Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see how some reading this may assume that Trump is now the conspiracy that we must fight and take down. However, this is mistake. Those of us who have been <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.2?lang=eng#1">quick to observe</a> have been keenly and painfully aware of conspiracies for the past decade and for others, much longer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you wake up too late, because you’ve been oblivious to reality in your slumber, you run the risk of waking up “on the wrong side of the bed”, being confused as to what is good and what is evil. Satan is a master of deception. Consider - the country is at more than just a political divide. Truly, we are at an ideological divide. But, we cannot pass judgment on whether people are “worthy Christians” because the deception runs very deep and we are taught that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24 they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/29.24?lang=eng#23">Isaiah 29:24</a> (Bible)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it’s not our place to pass defining judgment, but we can and should judge light from dark; the Book of Mormon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.14-19?lang=eng#16">tells us how</a>.</p>

<p>If you are to understand the year 2016 and why America chose Donald Trump - despite the condemnations of virtually every establishment sector, you <em>must</em> understand: things were bad - <em>really bad</em> - and mainly due to the conspiracies and secret combinations that were undermining our democracy and our freedom.</p>

<p>If you are not aware of these workings in darkness, and you do not seek to understand them at least a little, then it seems only natural to hate Trump and think his supporters have lost their minds.</p>

<p>This is not the be-all, end-all - this is <i><b><em>a piece</em></b></i> of the puzzle in taking the red pill to wake up to our awful situation.</p>

<p>I took <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/8.24?lang=eng#24">Mormon’s advice</a> and woke up nearly five years ago because some friends told me about the Federal Reserve and how it’s a private entity. This led to a five-year long search and study of the world and what the driving forces are. What I found disturbed me and caused me to bear a burden for many years. So, if Trump’s victory is hurting you, it should. You’re experiencing the <em>opposing energies</em> that were already there, at play between two powerful forces. Now, it’s finally all out in the open - thank Heaven. Trump supporters have been bearing this burden for years prior to the election. He simple harnessed the song of angry people into a political movement.</p>

  <li>“If it was bad for you, they wouldn’t sell it!”</li>
  <li>“If they knew more, they would tell us!”</li>
  <li>“The government wouldn’t lie to us.”</li>
  <li>“The media wouldn’t lie!”</li>
  <li>“I don’t trust anything but reputable, mainstream news outlets!”</li>
  <li>“There no PROOF!!” - Ahh, but the question you should be asking yourself is why there hasn’t been an investigation despite the evidences in question? “There is NO evidence!” - Saying there is no evidence does not mean there is no evidence. Claims <em>must</em> be addressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t be naive. Corruption seeks: MONEY. POWER. EVASION OF LAW. At <em>any</em> cost.</p>

<p>Conspiracies exist, and we must wake up from the slumber with which mainstream media entrances us and grasp the <em>context of reality</em> if we are to see things as they are.</p>
