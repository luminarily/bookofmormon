<p>Antifa and the shadow government find a comparison in this by staging their insurrection against the elected government.</p>

<p>So what can we learn from the Book of Mormon about this situation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and <strong>desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land</strong>; therefore there arose a <em>warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed</em>.</p>

  <p>5 And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be <strong>dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men</strong>, for they were desirous that the <strong>law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government</strong> and to establish a king over the land.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.4-5?lang=eng#3">Alma 51:4-5</a> (Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep reading‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6 And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of <strong>freemen</strong>; and thus was the <strong>division</strong> among them, for the <strong>freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.</strong></p>

  <p>7 And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was <strong>settled by the voice of the people</strong>. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.</p>

<h2 id="the-freemen-won-the-dispute-by-the-democratic-vote-of-the-people">The <em>freemen</em> won the dispute by the democratic vote of the people.</h2>

<p>So, the king-men were had to comply with the interests of the country; however, we will see that this did not last and they became a danger to the country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8 Now those who were in favor of kings were <strong>those of high birth</strong>, and they sought to be kings; and they were <strong>supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.</strong></p>

<p>Sound familiar? Hollywood elite? Fortune 500 CEO elite? Media elite? Political elite? Shadow government elite? These groups certainly seem to fit profile of the king-men.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9 But behold, this was a <strong>critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi</strong>; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.10?lang=eng#9">Alma 51:9</a> (Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a <em>very</em> precarious time of war to be having an internal conflict for the Nephites -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12 Yea, even <strong>Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites.</strong> And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the <em>same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran.</em></p>

  <p>13 And it came to pass that <strong>when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms</strong>, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This internal strife had now become a <em>direct and present threat</em> to the security of the entire Nephite nation. Here they were, with a hostile army at their borders and there was a group within that threatened the success of the entire country.</p>

<p>Captain Moroni, one of the great heroes in the Book of Mormon, brought down the hammer of justice on the king-men.</p>

<p>This excerpt speaks for itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>14 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the <strong>stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve</strong>; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them.</p>

  <p>15 <strong>And it came to pass that <em>he sent a petition</em>, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and <em>give him (Moroni) power</em> to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.</strong></p>

  <p>16 For it was his <strong>first care</strong> to put an end to such contentions and dissensions <em>among the people</em>; for behold, <strong>this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction.</strong> And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.</p>

  <p>17 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty.</p>

  <p>18 And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and <strong>they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.</strong></p>

  <p>19 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for <strong>there was no time for their trials at this period.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Moroni was angry with his own citizens who fought against his efforts to preserve THEIR freedom.</li>
  <li>Moroni knew he had to remove the <strong>internal dissent and division</strong> before he could face the external threats. THIS IS HAPPENING BEFORE OUR EYES. I think Trump will fail if he does not confront the rogue elements within the government.</li>
  <li>Moroni <em>got permission</em> from the governor of the land (i.e. the president) to quash the king-men.</li>
  <li>The contentions and dissensions <strong>among the people</strong> had been the cause of ALL of the destruction of the Nephites. A house divided cannot stand. Those king-men who do not accept the results of the election, who fight against the national flag, cause great national difficulty and tribulation.</li>
  <li>The hour is late; the stakes and threats are great - there is no time to just ‚Äúlet things work themselves out.‚Äù This is why Trump has decided to go after ALL of the king-men - not just those outside of the government. If you threaten national security, you will not be held blameless by the government or the people.</li>

<p>Nevertheless, Moroni was able to be successful - though the Nephites suffered greatly due to <em>their own</em> dissensions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Because mainstream media does not fairly report on violence <em>against</em> Trump supporters, the narrative is that Trump supporters are the violent ones.</p>

<h4 id="this-is-due-to-the-overton-window-principle---where-the-media-controls-what-gets-the-most-coverage-thus-controlling-what-the-public-thinks-is-a-problem">This is due to the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù principle - where the media controls what gets the most coverage, thus controlling what the public thinks is a problem.</h4>

<p>For those who have become aware of this reality, it‚Äôs very difficult to read things on page 6 of some local newspaper of an event that should be getting national coverage. Thanks to the Internet, these stories have been able to get massive coverage as the ‚Äúnew media‚Äù has been growing in popularity.</p>

<p>I have been criticized for sharing instances of violence against Trump supporters on my Facebook feed - people say these are ‚Äúisolated‚Äù instances or that I‚Äôm just being negative. Their more offended that I‚Äôve posted the article than they are about what‚Äôs <em>in</em> the article!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.attacksontrumpsupporters.com/">This website</a> contains an encyclopedia of all of the violence committed against Trump supporters - so you cannot defend the ‚Äúit‚Äôs isolated‚Äù argument.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to know what‚Äôs <em>really</em> happening in world, otherwise you open yourself up to being deceived not knowing which side is by and large engendering and inciting violence and social unrest.</p>

<p>Why does this concept encounter such resistance? Why do people immediately put up their defenses when they are told to acknowledge correlation? Why do they automatically say ‚Äúcorrelation does not prove causation,‚Äù as if this statement proves there is no causation-connection? What do they mean?</p>

<p>But, I digress.</p>

<p>Now what? Well, we must pay the price of dissension and lawlessness.</p>

<p>Due to the king-men, the Lamanite army was <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.26-27?lang=eng#25">able to take many Nephite cities</a>. Many lives were lost as a bloody trail followed the Lamanite advance. However, Moroni‚Äôs decisive courage to face <a href="/2017/03/06/modern-gadianton-robbers.html">Gadianton‚Äôs followers</a> directly enabled the Nephites to stabilize the situation and regain control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>16 Yea, <strong>had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves</strong>; yea, were it not for these <strong>king-men</strong>, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among ourselves, <em>if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies</em>, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength of the Lord, <strong>we should have dispersed our enemies</strong>, for it would have been done, according to the fulfilling of his word.</p>
