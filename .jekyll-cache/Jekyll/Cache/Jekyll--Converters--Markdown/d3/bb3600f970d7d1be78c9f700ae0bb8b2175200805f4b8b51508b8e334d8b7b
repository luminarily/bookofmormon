<p>Workers and robbers cannot coexist. We must “fumigate” the swamp and cause the swamp creatures to reveal themselves. Then, we must go after them with the full force of the law. This is the only way for America to retore herself to the Republic.</p>

<p>We must purge government corruption if we are to succeed. Unfortunately, conspiracies are a <a href="/2017/02/21/conspiracies.html">very real thing</a>, and, like any other living thing, will fight viciously to protect themselves.</p>

<p>In the Book of Mormon, there was a man by the name of Gadianton who founded the “Gadianton Robbers.” These robbers have a modern parallel in the current “far left”, “Antifa” movement as well as the “The Swamp” in D.C.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 For there was one Gadianton, who was <strong>exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery</strong>; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/2.4?lang=eng#3">Helaman 2:4</a> (Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gadianton’s influence, because it was not purged from the Nephites, grew like an infestation…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>13 And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this <strong>Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/2.13?lang=eng#12">Helaman 2:13</a> (Book of Mormon)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gadianton practiced the principle of “Mahan” - which is the central, guiding philosophy behind Satan’s kingdom on Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>31 And Cain said: Truly I am Mahan, the <strong>master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain.</strong> Wherefore Cain was called Master Mahan, and he gloried in his wickedness.</p>

<p>Millions are now aware: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4mes7q/here_is_a_list_of_all_the_clinton_associates_that/">death follows certain D.C. elites</a>. Journalists are found dead. Accountants and computer scientists go missing.</p>

<p>In this world, you can murder and be “successful”. It’s an awful thing, but in a fallen world such as this, it’s a reality that evil people sometimes avoid the consequences of their actions. Make no mistake, Whether in this life or the next, Justice WILL claim his own.</p>

<p>Christ proclaimed,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/8.36?lang=eng#35">Mark 8:36</a> (Bible)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Despite Jesus’ sober and dire warning, there are many who choose power and influence through Mahan, over their own souls.</strong></p>

<p>Despite the light of Christ and contrary to their own conscience, they allowed themselves to be deceived by Satan - step by step, lie by lie - into a living hell they only thought possible in their nightmares. Consider on the state of politicians who live a life in constant fear of being “found out” and in fear of their dark deeds being discovered. How sad - for the things they have done, and for the existence they live.</p>

<h2 id="no-he-got-them-from-satan-just-like-cain-did">No, he got them from Satan, just like Cain did.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>26 Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, <strong>they were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being</strong> who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit—</p>

  <p>27 Yea, <strong>that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world.</strong> And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, the prayers of the righteous are answered, and the judgement of God does come down on the followers of Mahan from time to time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>40 And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous’ sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Vigilance against what? <strong>Mahan</strong> and those who follow such dark plans.</p>

<p>Hundreds of years later, the plans of Gadianton resurfaced and this time it lead to the entire destruction of the Nephites, save it were a few who were mingled with the Lamanites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>42 And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began again to build up the <strong>secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton</strong>.</p>

  <p>43 And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began to be proud in their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, and become vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.</p>

  <p>44 <em>And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the world.</em></p>

  <p>45 And it came to pass that when <strong>three hundred years</strong> had passed away, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another.</p>

  <p>46 And it came to pass that the <strong>robbers of Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land</strong>; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did <strong>traffic in all manner of traffic.</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully, we have a chance to face these Gadianton robbers HEAD-ON and END THEIR TRAFFICKING RINGS. Donald Trump has gone on the offensive, and the corruption at the head of our government might actually be finally revealed to the mainstream for what it truly is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Donald Trump</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The battle has only begun. The Freedom Movement is beginning to go on the offensive. We have a chance to purge the evil from our midst and create a prosperous future.</p>

<p>This is what will be happening over the next few months. Pay attention to the news. Lord willing, predicated on our faith, those who sought the destruction of our nation will be discovered, humiliated and brought to justice.</p>
