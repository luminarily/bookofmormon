The Book of Mormon is an inspired work chronicaling the doings of several ancient civilizations, including the Nephites, Lamanites and Jaredites.

These nations were located in the Americas. The Lord has caused these lands to be cursed for the wicked's sake and blessed for the righteous' sake.

Thus, the transpirings of past civilizations on this contenant are of great worth to those who inhabit it, as history is doomed to repeat itself unless we learn from it and heed the lessons of the past lest we befall the same fate.

The Book of Mormon, in this sense, was written for our day, the day of America's power. For, as goes America, so goes much of the world.

In this sense, the *entire* Book of Mormon is a prophetic work - not just those passages which are overtly prophesying.

This site is dedicated to amazing relevance of the Book of Mormon and Bible to our day.
