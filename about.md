I've studied the Book of Mormon for much of my life. I wish to share what I've learned with anyone who will listen.

I feel the Book of Mormon is largely underappreciated and often misunderstood. Of a truth, it testifies of Christ and the entire book is chock full of prophecy and spiritual nourishment. I've always had an interest in coding and web dev, so it made sense to share my spiritual beliefs in a medium with which I'm familiar.

Anyone is welcome here - even if you have no interest in the Church, perhaps out of curiosity you will find the content here interesting if only as a religious study.

With that said, I believe we are closer than ever to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Many of the events taking place are shrouded in thick, cryptic events and language. Without watching, deliberately, conscientiously, and through the lense of what the scriptures say, I think there's a real risk of missing out and not seeing the events transpiring for what they are: fulfillment of prophecy.

Indeed, culture, social norms and stigmas have gotten to a point where one is quickly labeled a conspiracy theorist by others because of the simple act of "watch ye therefore". This trajectory has lead us to an environment where one cannot watch for Christ without being judged and labeled.

My target audience is anyone who will listen.

Open your mind. Suspend your doubt.

The world is not what it seems, and the Book of Mormon has been warning us for decades about what is coming.

We have been taught as saints by our prophets that we are under great condemnation for not receiving the Book of Mormon fully.

I believe the Book of Mormon is one of the most prophetic books in the world that we currently have access to. Because of this, I have filled my posts with scriptures from it, as well as the Bible, because I find these texts sufficient to inform us of the truth. They should be, at least... but, regardless, I have felt a strong desire to make this website and these posts.

The Book of Mormon is an inspired work chronicaling the doings of several ancient civilizations, including the Nephites, Lamanites and Jaredites.

These nations were located in the Americas and eventually were destroyed. The lessons of their falls are directly applicable to us and the world. We are commanded to watch. This includes studying and understanding the scriptures and looking for events which can bolster our faith in the truth and help us be prepared, spiritually for sure and temporally if possible, for what is to come.

The Lord has caused these lands to be cursed for the wicked's sake and blessed for the righteous' sake.

Thus, the transpirings of past civilizations on this contenant are of great worth to those who inhabit it, as history is doomed to repeat itself unless we learn from it and heed the lessons of the past lest we befall the same fate.

The Book of Mormon, in this sense, was written for our day, the day of America's power. For, as goes America, so goes much, if not all, of the world.

In this sense, the *entire* Book of Mormon is a prophetic work - not just those passages which are overtly prophesying.

This site is dedicated to amazing relevance of the Book of Mormon and Bible to our day in hopes this information might help others to come to Christ, as it has helped me.
