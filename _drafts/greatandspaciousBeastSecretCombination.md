## The Great and Spacious building, the Beast of Revelation & the Secret Combination are (probably) the same thing

Or, at least have *significant* overlap. The implications of this are astounding.

The beast, being generally accepted as being a "system", if it was the building - would that not lend new meaning to how one interacts with the world? Indeed, understanding world events could be influenced by making this one connection. With this understanding, one can see the how institutions and powerful players mock those who seek Christ. They are elevated as such that they have power to cause shame, or jealousy, in the hearts of the believers who heed them.
