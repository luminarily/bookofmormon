# What is the Great & Spacious Building?

In short, Lehi, a prophet, saw a tree with precious fruit in a dream. This tree was the love of God and he saw people trying to obtain the fruit of the tree.

Do read [1st Nephi Chapter 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng) for the full vision.

> 26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the cair, high above the earth.
> 
> 27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.

# Who inhabits the Great & Spacious Building?

## *Not* All Non-Believers

> 28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.
> 
> 31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building.
> 
> 32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads.
> 
> 33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
> 
> 34 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen away.
> 
> [1st Nephi 8:28,31-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.28,31-34?lang=eng&clang=eng#p31)

<div class='b cb3'>
	Although many entered the building, many of the individuals who saw the building "fell away into forbidden paths", "wandered in strange roads", or were "drowned in the depths of the fountain". They did not enter the building.

> 36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that **the great and spacious building was the pride of the world**; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[1st Nephi 11:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36?lang=eng&clang=eng#p36)

Nephi also saw the dream and learned that the building was the pride of the world. Two interpretations come to mind. 1) the general pride of the world in any worldly philosophy and 2) the pride of the world in something the world had created - such as a *system*, or great organization of control.

This post will focus on the latter interpretation. In this sense, the pride of the world is the same as beast of revelation which came out of the water and at first appeared to be separate beasts but as it rises, one can discern the necks meet into a single body. Wouldn't the world take great pride in the beast? For the beast has great power and many worship the beast, and thus the dragon. But, the beast deserves its own post, though it seems likely that the building and the beast very well could be one in the same, or at least have significant overlap.

## Hollywood

Movie stars. Producers. Musicians. Celebrities. Not all of them, obviously!

But, you can often tell which ones put out content that is degenerate in nature and not wholesome & uplifting.

(katy perry, kevin spacey, patton oswalt, etc...)
