# What is the Great & Spacious Building?

In short, Lehi, a prophet, saw a tree with precious fruit in a dream. This tree was the love of God and he saw people trying to obtain the fruit of the tree.

Do read [1st Nephi Chapter 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng) for the full vision.

> 26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
> 
> 27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.

# Who inhabits the Great & Spacious Building?

Identifying who *really* inhabits the great and spacious building is important because it can help one identify the beast system (and defend themselves and their family against it.)

I won't provide a comprehensive list of every player and related evidence, there is enough available.

## Not Who You Might Think

One might think anyone who falls into sin might as well be entering the building. This doesn't hold weight. The building, being the pride of the world, gives one an elevated status above others. Does the drug addict down the street have an elevated status? They may be traveling down a strange and forbidden path, but I wouldn't classify them as being elevated in the building. The building gives those in it wordly authority and power. [Sound familiar](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13.1-2?lang=eng#1)?

Indeed, they are elevated as such that they have power to cause shame, or jealousy, in the hearts of the believers.

> 28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.
> 
> 31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building.
> 
> 32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads.
> 
> 33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
> 
> 34 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen away.

<div class='b cb3'>
	Although many entered the building, many of the individuals who saw the building "fell away into forbidden paths", "wandered in strange roads", or were "drowned in the depths of the fountain". They did not enter the building.

> 36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that **the great and spacious building was the pride of the world**; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[1st Nephi 11:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36?lang=eng&clang=eng#p36)

Nephi also saw the dream and learned that the building was the pride of the world. Two interpretations come to mind. 1) the general pride of the world in any worldly philosophy and 2) the pride of the world in something the world had created - such as a *system*, or great organization of control.

This post will focus on the latter interpretation. In this sense, the pride of the world is the same as beast of revelation which came out of the water and at first appeared to be separate beasts but as it rises, one can discern the necks meet into a single body. Wouldn't the world take great pride in the beast? For the beast has great power and many worship the beast, and thus the dragon. But, the beast deserves its own post, though it seems likely that the building and the beast very well could be one in the same, or at least have significant overlap.

## Hollywood

* Spacey
* Weinstein
* Epstein
* Allison Mack & NXIVM
* Patton Oswalt
* Rachel Chandler
* Marina Abramovic
* Gal Gadot, et al. (singing 'there is no heaven ... no hell' at a time when we need God now more than ever)
> 22 And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is noneâ€”and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
> 
> [2 Nephi 28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22?lang=eng#p22)

These are just the ones that come to mind. What about the odd New World Order symbolism of Katy Perry's videos? Or Lady Gaga's close connections to Marina Abramovic? Or what about Gal Gadot et. al. coming out and singing "imagine there's no heaven ... no hell" during a time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hollywood bloviates about how we not build walls, while they are surrounded by guns, body guards safe within their personal mansion walls.

The hypocrisy is real and I could go on an on about this. I am assuming some level of awareness by my audience about Hollywod. It should be quite easy to connect the dots.

Hollywood is, without a doubt, part of the Great and Spacious Building.

## Politicians

The Cabal is a general term to describe the first beast. Its native language consists of threats and intimidation. It operates in darkness, subversion, consumption and code.

The Cabal is also known as the deep state, shadow government or permanent government. It has ties to some of the most vile groups on the planet.

Think Federal Reserve, Fast & Furious, Iran Nuclear Deal, CIA, Operation Mockingbird, MK-Ultra, etc...

## CEOs

CEOs, mainly. But also, "philanthropists"

Have you noticed the thousands of CEO resignations in the past couple of years? There is no coincidence when there is that much money and power involved.

## Puppet Masters

Family dynasties
