## Hollywood

* Spacey
* Weinstein
* Epstein
* Allison Mack & NXIVM
* Patton Oswalt
* Rachel Chandler
* Marina Abramovic
* Gal Gadot, et al. (singing 'there is no heaven ... no hell' at a time when we need God now more than ever)
> 22 And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is noneâ€”and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
> 
> [2 Nephi 28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22?lang=eng#p22)

These are just the ones that come to mind. What about the odd New World Order symbolism of Katy Perry's videos? Or Lady Gaga's close connections to Marina Abramovic? Or what about Gal Gadot et. al. coming out and singing "imagine there's no heaven ... no hell" during a time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hollywood bloviates about how we not build walls, while they are surrounded by guns, body guards safe within their personal mansion walls.

The hypocrisy is real and I could go on an on about this. I am assuming some level of awareness by my audience about Hollywod. It should be quite easy to connect the dots.

Hollywood is, without a doubt, part of the Great and Spacious Building.
