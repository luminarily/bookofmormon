"All religions are strategically put into place for behavior modification and confusion ... Most young people donâ€™t know the difference between Catholicism, Judaism, Muslimism, Christianity, Mormonism, Scientism and so forth."

	11:59 "America was always a masonic experiment founded by st. gemaine that got taken over by the cabal and now st. germaine wants it back" This doesn't seem to reconcile with what prophets have said on the subject.
		"19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations." 1ne 13:19
	12:19 "Then there's the promise of prosperity and world peace. These are the same talking points given by the light luciferians or the illuminati. People spend their days deciphering Q drops, but not bible prophecy" - the whole reason I got into the Q was because, having a penchant for Book of Mormon and Bible prophecy as it relates to the latter-days, I found it to be well in line.
		- The Nephites built walls to protect themselves.
		- Zechariah 12 - Israel would be a burning sheaf to those around it. Yes, there are corrupt individuals within, but it doesn't matter how prophecy is fulfilled. Zechariah states the Lord would make Jeruslem a cup of trembling, not the cabal.
		- The majority of the Nephites were engaged in the battle of their lives and their freedom. If we are to do the same, how does one get the majority of Americans awake and involved in not letting the secret combinations get above us? The Q movement fits the bill

	12:39 "Even worse, because they believe so much in Q, they deny that we're in the tribulation or in the end times because we're promised such a fantastic future of freedom and prosperity." This isn't accurate, not for me at least. I 100% believe we are in tribulations leading to the Second Coming. Part of tribulation is social unrest, political warfare, etc... I'm just of the hopeful and optimistic view that not only is the millennium coming, we are taking part in preparing the way of the Lord by preparing the nations of the earth to be a little better, a little more honest, and free of the corrupt cabal.

	6:26 - the yellow vests in europe all "worship" Q. Why does she say worship? This is mind-boggling to me. Q is simply a signature, not an Icon of Worship. What can we rally behind without being accused of false worship? Humans are sheep... all of us are. Good is not enough! We need leaders and symbols for our simple minds to latch on to. We learn that also in the Book of Mormon by Captain Moroni's example. If Q is a symbol of worship because people see it as a symbol of revolution and fighting back against the corrupt powers-that-be, then the Title of Liberty could be argued to be the same. The issue is not the symbol or the icon, as these things can help unify people around a common cause. The issue is not recognizing the hand of God in all things as against none is his wrath kindled except those who fail to do as much.
	She is throwing a spin on the Q movement that is subtle, but her word choice is showing her bias. "Worship", "Prophet", etc... Q never claimed prophecy, it's military planning. People are passionate about Q. This does not constitute worship any more than being passionate about a certain candidate or some other worthy pursuit.
	8:18 How did she go from "the media is trying to convince everyone that Q is a fringe movement" ... "Worshiping something other than Yahweh God as if it were God is the very definition of idolatry." It's really hard to understand how shes drawing her conclusions and it doesn't Who is worshiping Q as if he were God?
	8:48 "Q is seen as speaking for God on earth" ... ... uhh, no. Q has access to military intelligence. If anything, she could say God's hand is in all things, lest we take credit for what we had no part in.
	9:40 She mentions "What about those who do not worship the image?" Who? Like Hillary Clinton? where Kasich slips up and says John McCain was put to death, as if anyone who opposes Q is put to death. If McCain was truly guilty of what has been strongly implied (betraying the country, funding ISIS, and orchestrating false flags resulting in civilian deaths to mislead the public) - why would she not focus on and mention that? This is definitely a negative spin on Q and not objective commentary. Some things must remain classified to the very end Q says, and the circumstances around McCain's passing are one of those things I believe. The public can only handle so much.
	Also, when Q says "US Military = savior of mankind. We will never forget" he is referring to the lives lost, the sacrifices made in the face of unimaginably-high stakes and risk - much by unsung heroes to restore our country.
	He also said "You are the saviors of mankind." Does this constitute supplanting Christ? If so, how can we as members of the Church claim to be saviors on mount Zion with respect to genealogical work?

This is where I think if she had the Book of Mormon, and even the D&C, it would bring a great deal of perspective:
	- If we take the narrative in the Book of Mormon as being written 'for our day' in the sense that what the Nephites went through, their struggles to gain freedom and fight the internal strifes
	- Mormon clearly states in Ether that we are commanded to fight against the beast lest it get above us. And we know God does not give commandments without providing a way for us to accomplish them.
	- The Q narrative fits with the prophecies in the Book of Mormon more than what Alexandra says. Great & Spacious building (look at how much the celebrities have lost the respect of the people, how people revolt when they see marina abramovic being endored by microsoft, etc...) whether or not the great and spaciouss building is falling, it certainly is a fractal / microcosm of such an event.
	- Walls? Check (cptn. Moroni building walls). Israel? Check. (Zechariah 12) Secret Combination? Check. Great & Spacious Building? Check (celebrities losing face, people finding joy in reality rather than fantasy)
	- "And they shall overcome all things" - Christ shall save us spiritually (which is the ultimate saving act), but we came down here to face evil. To learn, both as individuals and collectively. So, even nations must go through tribulation.
	A) She says she's been following this stuff for a long time, but the Book of Mormon has been following it for much longer.
