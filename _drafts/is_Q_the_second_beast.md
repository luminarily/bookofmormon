In a social media group, a question was posed by an individual:

```
I know this group may be a little biased to ask, but to any Christians out there that have studied Bible prophecy, have you thought about the possibility that Q is the “false prophet” spoken of in Revelation 13?

We know that Satan masquerades as an “Angel of Light” trying to deceive. And we know that the False Prophet precedes the Antichrist. 

That being said, things are only going to get worse until Christ returns, so why should we expect things to get better before then. 
Thoughts?

# By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them

I have been following Q, post by post, since 2017 and never once did I get a "false prophet" impression. Military intelligence. Period! Throughout history God has influenced people, prophets or not. Just because someone is doing good doesn't mean they are a false prophet for Heaven's sake!

"By their fruits ye shall know them" How many people are coming to God as a result of Q's posts? How many people are awakening to evil for the first time because of Q? How much good does one have to do before you, in your great wisdom, will accept their offerings? How much blood has to be spilled before you are satisfied such that you can say it is good? People have died fighting the first beast. If you are looking for a second beast, then look at Coronavirus maybe. It came out of the earth and is causing all to worship the first beast (globalist system), is it not?

After Q's 4000+ posts and all of these evidences (the Q proofs) and good fruits, people come back with a weak argument of "Q's the second beast" - look, you can entertain those, that's fine, but as it stands the argument doesn't hold water, is weak and frankly insulting to those who are making sacrifices for your freedom.

# "People are worshipping Q"

- People are worshipping Q. This isn't really an argument. It's more of an allegation. Just because Q is the letter of security clearing and the alias that Q chose does not mean people worship Q. It's a remarkably weak argument with no supporting evidence. If people are "worshipping" Q, that's on them. Q has not caused any of the like behavior and has said "no ego", has referenced God and Christ many times and how this is a war between good and evil. Was it Nephi's fault that Laman and Lemuel fell down to worship him? No... and not that people are falling down to worship Q, because they're not, but 

# "Q is a false prophet"

# Arguments For Q

# Christ is the one who will save us

What, in the Q narrative, suggests this to be otherwise?
