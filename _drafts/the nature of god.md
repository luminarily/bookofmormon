d&c 88
41 He acomprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever.

He opposes Hell. How can God, a being of peace and love, overcome such evil? Evil that doesn't rest and fights tooth and nail, with weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth?

Because God's will, as I see it, opposes entropy (which, to me, is a hellish force).
Nephi commanded to build a boat.
Nephi commanded to get the plates, which Laman and Lemuel thought was a hard thing.
Eternal Burnings (this is the celestial energy which opposes and overcomes the evil, powered by the righteousness of those who possess this gift. The power, and will, to create, do good and resist evil. So, is God idle? No, in fact God truly did rest on the 7th day, did He not? Because he worked as only He could to create the Universe.

In your life, do you feel the nagging feeling sometimes that you have to do something? Chances are, that is the light of Christ, which penetrateth the darkness of space and animates all things. Meaning, as you follow that nagging to do good (perhaps pay a bill, or call a friend), you add to the glory of God and to your own salvation. This action, to do good, is the opposing energy to Hell, which is a destructive force and creates chaos in a cosmic void - the bottomless pit.
